    "comments": "It's hard to find good Vietnamese food in Nashville, so I'm always excited when a new restaurant opens up. Unfortunately, this is not the best place for Viet food. I had an order of pho with flank beef and beef balls. The broth was okay. Not very flavorful and the broth was too clear. Noodles were good and there was a good amount. There wasn't enough beef in the bowl though, about 3 half pieces of beef balls and 3 slices of flank beef. Come on. I tried some of the vermicilli bowl with grilled pork. Pretty good. Nothing amazing. Also got a bento box to go (bulgogi, fried rice, tempura shrimp sushi, tempura, soup, small salad). The bulgolgi was really good! The fried rice was just okay, a little dry, which is weird for fried rice. It looked better than it tasted. Tempura was solid, but it's hard to screw that up. Was not a huge fan of the soup. You either love it or hate it. Sushi was just decent. Pretty small rolls and the rice was average. Overall, this restaurant was just average. Nothing is bad, but nothing is great either except the bulgogi.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Good food, great prices.I went to Sriracha for dinner on a Saturday night with my fiance's brother (we took him food to go, because he had to work late). He was craving pho. And I was craving sushi. We both got what we wanted at Sriracha! I had two rolls for about $5-6 a piece (one Philly, one yellowtail). And he had a bowl of pho for cheap, too. The BBQ pork rice dish we took home for my fiance was $6. Such an affordable meal! And everyone liked what they ordered. The restaurant is simple and casual. The service was good. And they had TVs - so we could watch the college football during dinner! All in all, it was a great meal! And I'm sure my fiance and I will go back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They have Korean AND sushi!! Three of my favorites all in one place. For $6, the pho is pretty darn good and they give you a decent size bowl. The sushi has been surprisingly good, too! I mainly get sashimi but the fish quality isn't that bad for the price they have. My first visit there I had bulgogi. It's really saucy unlike actual Korean restaurants where it's more seasoning and flavors. It was still good, don't get me wrong, but it was almost too much sauce. It came with a side of dipping sauce that reminded me of seafood sauce that they serve at hibachi grills. This is definitely a go to spot for me and friends and I'd recommend it to anyone.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "It's always fun to explore the emerging food scene that is on Nolensville. Usually, it's just a lot of taco stands & Mexican restaurants, but other things are opening up, with Sriracha being one of them. They're a Vietnamese/Japanese restaurant with sushi, pho (noodle soup), com (rice) & bun (rice vermicelli). The restaurant is located in an older strip mall. It's not a fancy place, but that's okay. We stopped by for lunch on a Sunday around noon. We were greeted & picked where we wanted to sit. We picked a booth & I noticed immediately that they might've been a homemade job because the back on it was so straight up it was uncomfortable, but I wasn't going to be sitting there all day, so I got over it. I ordered the bun dac biet (3V). I didn't want to butcher the name of it, & before I could try, our server told me to tell her the number/letter combination as she didn't speak Vietnamese either. My dish was a \"combination of shrimp paste, sliced pork, grilled shrimp, & egg roll with rice vermicelli ($9). P ordered the pho dac biet (4P), rare beef, beef balls, sliced flank & tendon with rice noodles ($8). We also decided to split an eel roll ($7). The eel roll came first. It was okay. It was a little sloppy in preparation & the rice was kind of falling apart. I feel like they shine more with the Vietnamese food than the sushi. I wouldn't come here just for the sushi. The mains came out soon after. The presentation was great for both dishes. They use fresh herbs & it shows. Nothing was wilted & the protein wasn't over cooked. Naturally, a place named Sriracha had some Sriracha sauce on the table. For the price of $8-$9, both portions were large. I'd rate the pho a 3, the broth wasn't as complex as some id had in the past that were from broths that took days to make. The rice however was great. I'd say a 4. If I was back in the area, I'd have no issue coming here again, I'd probably skip the sushi though & get an egg roll.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm feeling a little under the weather with a headache and sinus problems so I decided to see if there was anything close to me on here and Sriracha popped up. They have such great reviews I was already there in my mind.This place is great. There is no where to get  Pho or Vietnamese close in south Nashville so I'm beyond excited that this opened up. They also offer a Japanese menu as well, so that's a plus! The BF and I shared the tempura shrimp and egg rolls. They came out hot and crunchy with great dipping sauces. I got the Pho with rare beef, beef tendon, flank, and beef balls. Do you know why? Because it was only $8.00. They gave me some extra chili  because I love mine spicy and it cleared my head. I have so much left over as well. I also got the Thai tea which you can't go wrong with that deliciousness. The boyfriend got the bento box with the Bulgogi (marinated beef), gyoza, and a crunchy shrimp roll. It also came with soup, salad, fried rice for an extra $1.00 and veggies. He even had left overs too.The Bulgogi was succulent and tender. GET IT. You won't be disappointed. All of this came to a whopping $33.00!  At this price, we decided this will be a staple in our rotation every week. Thank you for having something in the neighborhood that's delicious, easy on the wallet, and not to mention great service!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Love. I was a huge fan of this place. I tend to gravitate towards Vietnamese food in general. So this place has both vietnamese and Japanese food and it is split on the menu. They also shave a separate sheet for sushi orders. I tried the spicy crab roll I believe (my boyfriend picked it out). I felt skeptical that ot was a sushi roll... and only like $5, maybe $6... but it was definitely delicious. All of the entrees on the menu were less than $10. As I said, I gravitate towards vietnamese food, so the sushi roll was really the only Japanese item I tried. I ordered a noodle bowl with asian bbq marinated pork and grilled shrimp that came with a nuoc mam sauce, which is fish sauce based and delicious. I loved the pork, it was phenomenal. The shrimp was good but just a basic grilled shrimp. It also had a mix or vegetables in the noodle bowl but to the side. My boyfriend had the beef pho. It had one of the best broths I've tasted. Super good. Prices were better than reasonable and food was delicious. I'll for sure be back here!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Located in a shopping plaza near a Kroger, the food is authentic, good, and really affordable! Pho for $6? Pho-ck yes! I'm tired of having to pay $8-12 for pho just because there aren't enough pho restaurants here to keep prices down. I normally order Viet food at this restaurant even though they also have Japanese. The com thit nuong is delicious here, and my husband, who has had com thit nuong at every Viet restaurant in the Nashville area, deems this his favorite (in TN).

Usually restaurants that have a combination of asian cuisines is usually a big red flag for me. My friends really wanted to try so I went with them. Together we ordered vermicelli with grilled pork and eggrolls, pho tai, and pho tai, bo vien. When I walked in, I thought it would be a total disaster but it wasn't as bad as I thought! The grilled pork and egg rolls where great! The vermicelli was a little bit on the soft side which wasn't to my taste ( vermicelli is supposed to be a little on the dry end.) The pho was piping hot and the beef was not bad. The pho is alot milder tasting than the west coast but it was good. In addition, the prices were great! Over in the west coast, each dish would cost about 9-10 dollars but here, it is only 6-7!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I decided on the veggie bento box which comes with cabbage, zucchini, carrots and onions, white rice, miso, salad, and then your choice of a roll and/or gyoza. I went with the crunch shrimp roll and gyoza. For $10 this is an amazing deal, the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time and it's tasty! The service is always quick and friendly.

My mother ordered the pho combination, my mom makes good pho and when I say that I really mean it. So when she said it was good, that means it was good. Fresh side veggies and lots of meat in it. I got the Com Dac Biet, I wish they served it with the tiny bowl of broth like some Vietnamese places. It helps sipping on broth with the try food. I love the marinade on the pork chop, it was tasty. We also ordered fried oysters for our appetizers and actually didn't get them till we were done with our entrees because it slipped my mind that we never got them. The waitress felt very annoyed by the kitchen at this point, but it's also her responsibility to remember our order. Overall the food was good, maybe something I wouldn't try to from Murfreesboro a lot though. The kitchen needs to be organized a little better for food orders too.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Bottom line: Disorganized, wan, poor execution.  High aspirations with these two demanding Asian cuisines--Japanese and Vietnamese. Will get you by in a pinch if you are Jonesin' for pho, but if you want a right proper flavorful bowl the likes of which you can be assured of at Vn Pho Deli, this will sadden your soul. The sashimi we had was not good quality sush--a little gristly--but probably priced about right for the quality. We had pho, bun (vermicelli with grilled pork), and com sua (grilled pork chops), and salmon sashimi. The pho dac biet broth was thin, gray and wan. The slices of brisket dry and fatty--cooked too fast and without care. The pork on the vermicelli was overly sweet and absent the aroma and char from a grill. The sauce was unfamiliar--a thinned down sweet chili sauce maybe? An authentic sauce is so so easy and this is not the place to make a shortcut. The vermicelli was a bit overcooked.  Not springy. Either low quality or stale. No fish sauce on the table.  We had to ask for it and the broth needed it. My son ordered a Sierra Mist--completely flat and no flavor. When we asked for a replacement, we were told the CO2 was out. Hmmm. Did they know this when they gave us the drink. It's a pretty easy thing to detect when you're serving. No bubbles. Overall, there's a weird tentative air about the place. The gentleman with the blue tooth piece in his ear who seemed to be an owner/manager seemed put out when we asked for fish sauce--he probably was kicking himself inside, but the look on his face was annoyance with the request. There is lack of attention to detail and discipline that are hallmarks of Vietnamese cooking and culture. Maybe it's because this place is newly opened. I didn't see any hidden signs that someone in the kitchen knows what they're doing. For sushi lovers, it feels disconcerting to not be able to see the chefs preparing the sushi and the presentation is the same as for the Vietnamese food--sushi on lettuce. Hmmm. Makes it feel less precise, crisp and special. While I had hoped we would end up having a pho joint that we might like that is closer to us in Murfreesboro than far away Vn Pho Deli in West Nashville, it's not good enough to sate our souls and we'll keep making the trek to Vn Pho Deli where we actually feel healed after a meal. Checking this one off the list but will keep an eye on Yelp reviews to see if they ever recover.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ordered 2 sushi rolls the Ocean Roll and Sunflower as well as two bowls of Ramen Spicy Chicken and Spicy Shrimp. When our sushi came out I questioned one of the rolls that was supposed to be the Ocean Roll. It looked nothing like what the description described. I asked our waiter which roll it was. He said the Im not sure I think the Ocean. I asked him to ask the Sushi Chef. He came back a few minutes later and stated the Ocean. However when we got the bill it stated the Dragon Roll. My friend asked the Chef/ manager when he went to pay the bill if it was in fact the ocean or dragon as the bill stated. He asked was there green on top speaking about the Avacado. He said yes there was. The Chef stated it was the Dragon Roll. Meaning this waiter BALL FACE LIED TO ME inwhich I dont believe he ever asked anyone out of fear Id request the correct roll to be made. I ABSOLUTELY HATE LIARS. For this I will never spend another dime in this restaurant. I can not trust that I am getting what I ordered that they will give me just whatever they feel like. I love Pho and Ramen as well as Sushi so I seek out good restaurants that can serve this. However, because of this one Waiter you have lost a potential long time customer.

    "comments": "This mixed Vietnamese-Japanese restaurant just opened in a Nolensville strip mall, next to Babies R' Us (same complex as the Kroger at Old Hickory and Nolensville). We were excited to try it since my husband is Vietnamese and we live in Lenox Village, a few miles south.  It's a 25 minute drive to Charlotte Pike to the other Vietnamese restaurants in town, and we don't always want to spend 50 minutes in the car just to get Vietnamese food.  Food - The food was definitely good, but the Vietnamese selection is pretty limited.  Most of the appetizers are Japanese (gyoza, seaweed salad, squid salad, edamame).  We ordered spring rolls, which were good (shrimp, no pork in these but I actually prefer them that way; lots of fresh herbs and good peanut/hoisin sauce).  For Vietnamese entrees, they have 3 sections: pho, com (rice dishes) and bun (the rice noodle dish with your choice of meat and fish sauce).  There were 3 or 4 options under each of these sections. They have a relatively long sushi menu and a bunch of Japanese entrees, which I didn't really look at - I know they had udon and soba noodle dishes but don't remember the rest.  My husband got pho dac biet, and I got the bun dac biet (eggroll, marinated pork and shrimp).  The pho was good - my husband liked the broth, which is the key.  I liked the bun as well; the pork was very tasty.  The pho and bun bowls weren't huge but they were inexpensive compared to other places in town: $6-8 depending on which meat option you choose.  We also got one sushi roll, the volcano roll, which was very tasty (crab, shrimp, mango, spicy sauce and browned on top).We had good service - granted, it wasn't that busy since they had just opened a few days earlier, but they have 3 waiters/waitresses, which seemed like plenty for the size of the restaurant.  It was clean and new inside, as you'd expect.  TL;DR: It doesn't have the variety of the Vietnamese restaurants on Charlotte (granted, it's a Vietnamese-Japanese restaurant, so I shouldn't try to compare them).  That said, the food is good and if you're looking for a quick stop for Vietnamese food on the southeast side of Nashville, I would definitely recommend it.  We'll have to go back to try the udon and other Japanese items another time.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Much has been said of the unassuming exterior and they're not wrong but they're also not wrong about the food. Where to start...First, I sincerely believe that the photos on the menu don't do any of it justice, so don't be dissuaded if you are slightly put off by the photos. This was our first time going and I highly suggest getting a pupusa and two tacos. I had a chicken taco and a beef taco. My husband had two pupusas and two tacos and was extremely satisfied with the serving sizes. My pupusa experience was this: a warm, steaming pocket of greatness, with gooey cheeses, pork bits, and beans, that I topped with the curtido spicy coleslaw and the mild dressing. Sublime. The tacos were even better. The homemade tacos were a bit thicker obviously than what you might be used to (but so much better) and soft and warm under a bed of well seasoned meat, diced onions, cilantro, and sliced radishes. Every part of the taco was part of a well-orchestrated symphony of taste. The simple ingredients made for a filling but not heavy meal.And pricing?!?! Heh. Yes, about that. Especially if you are used to DC prices you will think there's been a serious mistake...like no way can food be this cheap ever...$2.25 for each papusa and $1.75 for each taco. Hands down the best meal and the best price we've eaten out in a long time. Service was great and we hope they continue to flourish. Muchas muchas gracias.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The pupusas here are made in house, handmade, and served fresh! They're pretty big too - I had 2 and I was sooooo full. I also tried their tacos (and everyone knows how much I love love love my street tacos!!!) and was pleasantly surprised by how authentic even the tacos tasted. I also was really happy when I saw that they had the green salsa to douse your pupusas & tacos in! They have Mexican coke!!!! So much better than regular coca-cola.

Look for the wall painted in the colors of the Salvadoran flag!The place was packed with day laborers when we arrived but our delightful server moved some tables around and cleared a spot for us. We instantly ordered the pupusas, tacos, and Mirinda - a Fanta like soda. Our steaming pupusas arrived in 15 minutes and we were in bliss - corn tortillas with the perfect filling of cheese and chicharron. Every table has a jar of curtido, spicy pickled cabbage, to eat with the pupusas. Our server also brought us two house sauces, one mild and one flaming hot, to round out the selection of commercial hot sauces at the table (Valentina, El Yucatan etc). I recommend the green flaming hot house sauce over everything else. The tacos were equally delicious with giant mounds of seasoned beef cubes on Salvadoran tortillas. We left stuffed to the gills. The meal for 4 cost us a grand total of $35 which made the experience even sweeter.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Being that Nashville has such a robust Central American community, I knew that I would find some gems once I spent the time looking for them. It came to pass, though, that I was tasked with finding gluten-free ethnic cuisine that skewed toward sabor latino. Done. Easy. To the queen we went.Traveling down this stretch of Nolensville, I always think that I need to spend more time digging around in this area. There's so much more to this city than The Gulch, 12 South and East End. It's a shame that more folks don't take the time to fully take in all the interesting sights, sounds and tastes the metro has to offer. Oh well. More for me. I knew to watch out for Timmons as I sped down Nolensville. Even though the address of the restaurant says Nolensville, the front (and parking) is on the side street. Once I parked, I walked in to find a small dining room, packed with folks chatting, watching soccer (2 TVs) and chilling out. I grabbed a menu and took a seat. True as was noted in previous reviews, I had a chance to dust off my Spanish (although the server speaks enough English to make ordering and communicating easy enough). I ordered a pupusa mixta (con queso, frijoles y cerdo) and the yuca frita con pescado. Done. Easy. I sat down and watched the game while my to-go food was made to order. Before too long my food was ready and it cost a whopping $9. That's what I'm talking about. Even better, since the food was made to-go, my server bagged up some curtido and sauce for the road. That's really what I am talking about.When I tell you that this food knocked my socks off, I am not giving it enough credit. The pupusa, on its own, was delicious. Thick, with a very pleasant texture, the bean, cheese and pork combo was a savory touchdown. When topped, however, with the curtido... oh my goodness. That's some next-level goodness. The yuca frita was a revelation. I'd had variations of the dish, but never quite like this. The dish came with numerous, generous chunks of tender (!) yuca paired with cabbage, radish, cucumber, and tomato. On its own, interesting. But, the queen took it to the next level with the addition of a cup or so of fried anchovies and the sweet orange sauce. Crazy.good. I couldn't believe what my mouth and belly were experiencing. I'd had Salvadoran food before but never as good as this. For $9, my culinary world was rocked and I had food enough for two meals. This place is going into my permanent rotation.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The moment you walk in, you notice that all the diners are hispanic and communicating your order is just a touch difficult as the family that owns the place is very much so spanish speaking. WIN WIN. That is a genuine sign of authenticity. You can clearly see the women in the kitchen hand making these papusas from very fresh and simple ingredients. LARD- YES. It ain't a papusa without some lard. The owners are incredibly welcoming and let me back in the kitchen to learn a thing or two about papusas. Everything is hand made and made continuously through the day so it is incredibly fresh. Some notables--they have home made soups that were very big with the construction lunch crowd. No idea as this is on the typical menu or a regular special... but it looked awesome. It looked like a vegetable menudo mix. Follow this tip.. just point to the guy that looks like a regular and ask for what he's having. I know some diners got a kick out of the little \"china-rica\" chowin' down on some caramelized bananas (please order me) with $1/each papusas. Bring cash! Its a small business and cash would be appreciated.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's tiny and decidedly not fancy, but the staff was friendly, it was very clean, and most importantly, the food was delicious. We had bean and cheese pupusas (we're vegetarian) and heaped the delicious mildly spicy fermented cabbage slaw on top (escabeche?). So, so tasty. We also tried the breakfast plate, and my 9-year-old asked if we could come for breakfast every Saturday. It was heavenly. We also tried the banana empanadas, and they weren't my favorite, but the rest of my family enjoyed them. Our lunch was about $25 for the five of us, and to eat so well for so cheaply feels like a real feat. We'll definitely return.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

At first glance, the menu didn't look promising for a vegan, but the server helped me choose a great pear salad with a balsamic vinaigrette, some sides, and best of all, an incredible brussel sprouts appetizer.

    "comments": "First time really back in Nashville in years brought me to this early evening gem of a restaurant.  Mason's is a small space in the Loews Hotel on West End.  There's a separate bar area from the main restaurant and it was filled with corporate convention types just after COB on a Thursday.  The restaurant sitting area it's else, however, was blank.  And I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. We had a few tables come in after we were already seated by Charles, whose memorable attire made him look as if he'd just carved up livestock in the back. The fare is upscale southern \"provisions\" not unlike several other spots I've frequented and--mainly--enjoyed from Nashville to Atlanta and Charleston.  Upon closer inspection, the menu reminded me of a few spots on the Square in nearby Franklin, TN.  But here we were at the Loews to which I'd only known because of its almost opulent Sunday brunch.We starred with a \"known\" quantity--fried green tomatoes--and two unknowns--crab corn dogs and Brussel spouts, which, btw are making a huge showing about the city.  More on this later.   But the fried green tomatoes were themselves almost a side show to their accoutrements of crab meat and a divine trio of peppers, zucchini and (pickled?) corn.  The crab corn dogs were decadent yet simple; it was like taking a visit back to a favorite snack from childhood... if perhaps I was Richie Rich.  And now the Brussel sprouts. Perhaps the hallmark of the meal might have been the little ceramic bowl of spouts with peanuts and chiles, currants (golden raisins in our case), and Benton's bacon.  I don't know who Benton is, but I'm sure he's sad without this delicious bacon. (note: vegetarians, you too, can have some without the bacon if you smile and ask nicely enough) Now the main entrée (or supper, for locals) for me was 2nd from the top on the \"heat\" list.  You see, Charles presented our dinner options based on their spiciness, savory or sweetness.  At the top was the shrimp and grits--which I normally get everywhere applicable.  But I wanted different and they delivered.  Thr Ancho-spiced Berkshire chop was large and in charge but will balanced by the wonderfully apportioned sea island peas, pulled pork (really? Yes) and mango jicama slaw.  Cilantro overtones kept it fresh while the early peas and smoked chili added depth to the heat. My better half isn't nearly as enthused by spice and therefore she chose the Halibut plank, which was probably the prettiest plating of the night, and rightfully so.  Shaved zucchini, snap peas and a Romesco sauce worth remembering made me ask the chef for the recipe. Challenge accepted, in other words. If there was anything less than stellar we had was the Rosarita, a rosemary infused pomegranate margarita.  Trust me, it wasnt bad... but it was dim compared to my second libation, the Cazerac, a neat pairing of whiskey, cognac and a touch of maple syrup and bitters.  The steelist is worth your while, too, if you don't mind em stiff.  To wind it all down... Fruit filled but savory crepes and a very assorted chocolate cake. And I hear they do brunch.  I'm game.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

He made my already fantastic dining experience that much more perfect. To start off, the jalapeño popovers are reminiscent of traditional Brazilian appetizer fare. They are melt-in-your mouth fantastic. The shrimp and grits was brilliantly spiced with tender chunks of andouille sausage, a prefect pair. Definitely my favorite shrimp and grits in Nashville. The crepes for dessert were also wonderful. Along with all of the magnificent food, their cocktails are out of this world. The old fashioned is perfect. I forget the other cocktail that is on the first page of the specialty cocktail menu that involves gin and some sorts of cherries and other deliciousness. I also had the opportunity to dine for breakfast and I will say the \"Black Keys\" Wrap is to die for with perfectly fried green tomatoes and dill horseradish. EPIC. 13.7/10 would recommend to anyone who has the ability to venture to downtown.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Very disappointed on the food quality based the many good review that rave about this place. We ordered several dishes: Crab corn dogs, Pear salad, South Caroline Grits, Halibut a la plancha, and Springer mountain farms chicken.First off the crab corns dogs, chicken, and grits were overly salted. The chicken was so salted that one bite was enough to send the dish away. The crab corn dogs tasted too grainy and the salt was slightly reduced by the sweet gremolata. The salt on the chicken entree came mostly from the glaze they used because the chick peas that were not touched with the sauce was not salty. The grits were good on the first bite, but eventually the salt took over. Maybe this was due to the salty corn dogs I had earlier.The pear salad passed in tasting. The citrus vinaigrette had no citrus taste, looked like the salad was just doused in oiled. The lack of flavor from the salad helped to temper the salty crab corn dogs. The squash detracted from this dish.The halibut was good for my fiance, but for my taste the fish lacked any seasoning. But luckily I had my salty dish to even this out. I am pretty much this wasn't how the meal was supposed to be eaten. To give this dance some credit, it was listed as a healthy option. So maybe the lack of salt was the point.However, despite the bad food, I'm thinking the chef had a bad day. The service was amazing. Servers were not overbearing, they knew when to come around to refill glasses. So for their service its a 5 star rating. Based on the food I ate, I won't be coming back.  Expected a lot more from this fine dining establishment.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

There's just something that has fallen slightly flat though on second go arounds....Mason's was my first meal of the New Year...unless you count the cold pizza at 2am after celebrating that night, but I digress, I'm gonna count regular ol' Mason's for that. Obviously my BF and I were not feeling in TIP TOP shape; (ie... I somehow managed to throw on a hoodie and brush my teeth, but yesterdays make-up MIGHT have still be on my face.. I cannot confirm or deny. So its around noonish and we walk up to the hostess. She's in a sous chef jacket and was out of her element. Not sure why she was up there greeting customers? But whatever, she told us they'd be serving brunch that day even though it was a Wednesday, and due to our hungover state, we decided to go casual in the bar area. The bartender hands us the regular menu and we ask if she has the brunch menu. \"Oh we aren't serving brunch.\" According to the sous chef you are? So she went and asked and confirmed that they were serving brunch. Ok, cool. I've been raving about the crab cake corn dogs, so we ordered those asap and then had some questions about the menu. The bartender was clueless and had to ask one of the servers.She said that they had recently changed the menu and that was the cause for her lack of knowledge but yikes. It was just rather unprofessional and caused more delays in us ordering our food. I had the shrimp and grits and my BF had a sandwich. My shrimp and grits were decent, but SUPER rich and a bit sweeter than I would have liked. I've had better. The sandwich was great though, and the crab cake corn dogs were heavenly per usual. Overall, just middle of the line really. I understand that there's some transition with a new menu, but your staff should be trained before it's provided to customers. Also, slightly let down with the food this go around. Will have to come back at dinner and give it another shot.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The seating area is so cozy and I love how it is separated from the restaurant. Left bar, right full service restaurant. Don't be like Zoolander, learn to turn left.The happy hour is where it's at. We got the crab cake corn dogs, wings, and something else that I can't remember. Our trip was December 6th so it's been a minute, plus the drinks were flowing. The crab cake corn dog was massive. To be exact, we received three massive ones. We honestly didn't need anything else.Our waiter was on top of it. Everything came out as it should have and in a timely manner. I honestly can't wait to go back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Absolutely outstanding dining experience. The food all the way from the appetizers, the soup, and closing with my main course was phenomenal. Just the right portions with tastes that brought a smile to my face. It's nice to leave comfortably full instead of stuffed or wanting more for a change. The drinks were fresh with great flavors. I wasn't left breathing fire or wondering if they made the drink out of water. They were expertly made. Finally, the service and ambience were top notch. I was asked more than once if everything was perfect. The wait staff was timely and if the waiter was busy then the manager took care of things without even being asked. Overall a definite 5-star in my book. I look forward to returning for another great meal.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This guy has more ideas than a fancy Ivy League college think tank and his execution would put even the most rabid dictators to shame. Too over the top of a description you say? Try the food at Masons and you will see why there are words to describe the flavors. I highly recommend starting with the JARS and the bone marrow beef cheek confit. Then the compressed patty pan and warm goat cheese. The entree is a tough spot to recommend, everything is good. The osso bucco is my favorite right now, but the shrimp and grits is a close second. Get all three desserts. Thank me later. You are welcome.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The decor and ambiance is very warm, inviting, & incredibly welcoming. The bar staff is highly skilled and prepared some of the best cocktails I've ever had. If you're not a TN native, be sure to try the local craft brews on tap! The food at Mason's is like nothing I've ever had. It literally blew me away. It was all expertly prepared, perfectly seasoned, mouth-watering, exquisitely elevated Southern comfort food. Every single dish we ordered was spectacular. We highly recommend the Fried Green Tomatoes with crab, zucchini & corn relish (These were AMAZING!), the Crab Corn Dogs, A Devil of An Egg, the Pimento Cheese BLT (was divine!) & the Beef Short Rib sandwich.... but seriously, everything is great. Chef Frohne & his team are so brilliant, the entire menu rocks. You just can't go wrong here. Try everything! It's a one in a million place with food you'll crave long after you go back to where ever you live - Believe me. I do!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ordered the kimchi collards and the fried green tomatoes with crab meat. Both were unbelievably delicious. I was nervous about the kimchi collards at first because I'm a connoisseur of both but if you like either one, you must try that combination. The fried green tomatoes were a little bland but the crab meat and sauce highlighted the flavor. I will try this spot again when I'm in the area.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'm saddened to give them 2 stars, but we hardly stayed for food. After seeing photos (and recommendation) post on Facebook of my then-neighbor's visit  o Mason's, my friends and I put it at the top of our list to try. We scoped the menu online, and got very excited for brunch. We made reservations, but didn't need them - the restaurant was nearly empty - there were only 3 other tables at noon on a Sunday. My friends had already ordered mimosas before I arrived (I was 10 minutes late) and didn't get them until about 25 minutes later. I was less than greeted by our server and she especially seemed annoyed when one of my friends requested to see a wine menu. I'm not sure when the server's attitude turned sour, but she began to slam items like cream and the wine list on to our table with no sense of customer service, walking away without even enough time for my friend to ask for a water and order a drink.  At this point, we all looked at each other and agreed we wanted to enjoy our brunch experience and discussed asking to switch servers or finishing up our drinks and heading to another place. We decided to request a manager from the hostess and discretely express our concerns. This experience was met with an excuse that someone didn't show up, putting them into a weird mood and the manager seemed less than caring of our complaint at first. We decided to just stick it out. The next time our server returned, I will giver her credit, her attitude was a complete turn-around from what we experienced just five minutes prior. If this had been they she acted from the beginning, I think this review would be much different. I also expect more from a mid-scale restaurant in a Lowes Hotel. The food was also just 'okay'. It's nothing I would run back for. The sausage in particular was not my favorite, it was milled very finely and had the texture of when ground beef is a pizza topping. I ordered my bacon extra-crispy and it came out normal, which was edible, but not my preference. After already going through the stress of the first 30 minutes of our experience, I didn't send it back; it wasn't worth it to me. The friend green tomatoes were excellent, but very small in portion. You get three tomatoes, crab and some sort of bean salsa, but the tomatoes were very small, maybe 2.5 inch diameter at most for $12. The manager did bring by 3 desserts on the house as a surprise for our poor experience which was nice of him. I am not much of a sweets person but these were very, very good. There was one that looked like carrot cake, but was not - I forget the name - this was my favorite of the three - their chocolate mousse cake with banana sauce was also very good. Of everything I had at the table, the desserts were the best, which I give credit for, but I really went for the brunch, so doesn't hold much weight in this review. I won't give this place another chance due to our terrible experience in the first 30  minutes pair with food that didn't wow me. There are just too many other options in the city to really give another chance to this place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Being celiac, I hardly get to eat a dessert and this is truly the best dessert I have ever had. They were understaffed, so it took quite a while to get the meals on the table but we were in no rush and manager was very nice and to compensate for the delay our desserts were on the house.

Started off with the crab corndogs and they were really great, but could have been hotter. Our server was not with it, so we had to remind her about my mimosa, more coffee, water took forever...My husband had the omelet with pimento cheese. How awesome does that sound?? I knew firsthand the pimento cheese was awesome from my last visit. However, the damn thing was cold! One would think you would cook the egg and not put freezing cold pimento cheese inside. Yeah, think hot egg, ice cold pimento cheese inside. eeek.I had pancakes made with ricotta. now those were pretty good. again, not piping hot. Service was slow (and they weren't busy) and the food was overall kinda cold. I think the actual menu and food is good if it's served hot and fresh and the service is good. So they definitely need to work on that. Maybe I'll give it another try...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ordered the heirloom grits as the ingredients only listed shiitake mushrooms, Gouda, and chives. I nearly took a mouthful of smoked ham when it arrived, thinking it was the shiitake mushrooms. The server was kind enough to have it remade sans the meat, but the menu definitely needs to be clarified.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The waiter was perhaps a little more proper than friendly, which didn't necessarily suit the southern charm the place is going for. We ordered two different appetizers, four entrees and two desserts.Comments:* The fried green tomatoes were great.* The crab corn dogs were done well, but I wasn't overly-impressed.* My wife's chicken was superb. It was excellent as leftovers a couple days later, also.* My lemon scallop meal was way, way too lemony. It had a lot of great players on the plate (asparagus, risotto, ham crisp, etc.), but the lemon shot all of them down except the scallops.* The pie for dessert was really good, as was the panna cotta (though the pc wasn't as good as the one that gets made at home).Thank you for building a special order hamburger for my friend. She was appreciative of the hospitable spirit the kitchen showed in that request.Next time I'll try the shrimp and grits or pork chop. I was leaning that way before I saw the lemon featured with the scallops. Then the lemon went and stole a star (or two) away from the review.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'm torn on Mason's. Maybe because Mason's has an identity crisis. It doesn't seem to know what it is. On the one hand, they'd like to present a down-home, rustic, sorta-hipster vibe. There's a cool wall of Mason jars in place of a plate glass window. The menu is one offwhite, old fashioned page screwed to a board. The napkins are dishtowels and the servers have dark blue jeans and white shirts with canvas aprons. But then there's a manager with a banker suit. And the very corporate big hotel feeling of the restaurant itself. The corporate carpet, the shiny tile, the pinlight lighting. The bar across the hall is loud, sound pouring into the restaurant.The food is southern comfort food with stepped up execution. It was excellent. We started with drinks. I enjoyed 2 Mason's Ol' Fashioneds and informed my wife that she would be driving. We enjoyed the Devil of an Egg immensely, but I'm forever perplexed by chef's who send out 3 of an appetizer, leaving the choice to cut one in half or be selfish and take the last one. For entree's, the shrimp and grits stands out. Although it should really be called tasso ham and collards on grits with some shrimp. I don't know why people focus on the shrimp. Tasteless little bugs that they are. The ham was amazing. The tasso gravy divine. The collards were perfect and maybe the best pot likker of all the pot likkers.The grits were creamy and corn flavored. Not the grainy grit you had somewhere else.The hangar steak was just ok. Served atop the creamy kale, it left my wife wishing she had ordered the collards. Kale stalks were tough and still there. There was nothing particularly wrong with this dish, but nothing that brought it up to being on this menu for this price.Finally, the Apple Gannette. It was good. Flaky pastry, but also not a standout.Perhaps a change of venue would help Mason's. I don't see how they break even, even with a pretty high ticket. The place was near empty. I imagine that they were easily staff with several more people than customers for the 90 minutes we were there.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The oatmeal brûlée was really a brûléed banana on oatmeal. It was very good oatmeal garnished with very good berries. The crispy potato hash was not crispy and had a peculiar, somewhat metallic taste. Lunch was excellent. The truffle salt on the French fries is a very nice touch, as is the watercress on the burger. The chicken salad sandwich was pretty basic but very well done. The choice and quality of fruit on the side in place of fries was excellent. Dinner was outstanding! The deviled eggs were a wonderful, imaginative twist on the classic. The crab corndogs are something every crab lover should experience. The shrimp and grits is an extraordinary twist on this southern staple. The goat cheese pannacotta was also excellent. The prices are high but reasonable.

Even the pickled okra was good. For my main course, I got the Roast beef and deviled crab sandwich, which was topped with butternut squash slaw, smoked pepper aioli and triple tam brie cheese. Fantastic flavors going on in this sandwich! We finished off the meal with a chef special dessert: GooGoo cluster frozen with liquid nitrogen and served like a small root beer float. Nice! They also have a great bar area.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Hotel restaurants tend to get a bad rap in the food world, but if you find yourself staying at the Lowes Vanderbilt Hotel, you will be in for a treat.I decided to dine here for a birthday celebration due to the good press Mason's consistently recieves in the greater Nashville area.If you are not staying at the hotel, you can valet your car.  Do not forget to ask your server for a vocher.  This is a big bonus in my book because it is always gracious of a hotel to pick up the valet tab for their customers.  The menu and decor both celebrates traditional Southern cuisine, however it didn't come off as upscale to me.  The menu and decor comes off as thoughtful, well planned with a side of kitsch.  Mason jars make up a majority of the decor.  The rich browns and clean lines make for a relaxing dinning room.  There is a private dining area on the side for larger groups (so keep that in mind yelpers if you are hosting a fun event).  I loved the bar menu, it was a leather bound booklet with a very beautiful picture of a rabbit on it.I started with the Peach Old Fashioned.  They infuse makers mark with peaches.  The house made hop bitters cut through the sweetness of the peaches making for a well balanced drink.  My friend tried the House Made tonic and gin.  The tonic had a bit of an earthy taste to it.  Once the cocktail was completed, the biggest win was it was Wine Wednesday.  Half price bottles of wine (yes please).The appetizer selection was good.  They were out of oysters, but I lived!  The crab corndogs are so good and the jars were a great complement.  I loved the pimento cheese and pepper jelly.  For dinner, I had the Chicken Gallatine with spicy collard greens and a turnip green puree.  All the flavors blended together beautifully and the chicken was very tender.  The Halibut and the Mason's burger were all enjoyed at the table.Lastly, the Elivs dessert was the best.  I am of firm belief that dinner should be chocolate, upon more chocolate with chocolate and chocolate, plus some ofther stuff.  So that being said, dark chocolate mousse, with a bacon white chocolate brittle, peanut butter and bananna jam could have been my 1st, 2nd and 3rd course.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This is certainly not your average hotel restaurant. The bar area is very cool-looking with Mason jar lights surrounding the bar, but we bypassed it to head to the dining room. The hostess was friendly and sat us immediately even though we were early for our reservation. For a Saturday night, I imagined it might be a little more full.We started off with cocktails - me with a Peach Ol' Fashioned and my husband with the Canna Manhattan. My drink was perfect - not too sweet with a little kick of bitterness on the end from the hop bitters. The Canna Manhattan had just the right touch of cinnamon, though it wasn't really what I was in the mood for on a warm July evening.I was looking forward to the starters the most, and we ordered in waves. First the jars of pimento cheese, pepper jelly, and lima bean hummus. Then the Devil of an Egg, which is a must-order. The crunch of the mustard seeds and smokiness from the bacon jam complemented the creaminess of the deviled egg. My husband nearly licked the jar of pimento cheese. We did have to request more crackers to go with the jars.Next up were the crab corn dogs and the fried green tomato. The presentation was stunning, but they didn't have the same wow factor of the previous order. The crab in both dishes didn't seem very fresh, and the taste of the oil from the fryer came on a little strong.By this time, I was getting full, so I ordered the sweet corn bisque instead of a full entree, and my husband selected the smoked pork and huitlacoche tacos. My soup was fabulous, obviously very fresh corn and the slight sogginess of the shrimp fritter added some texture. I had a bite of the tacos and was very impressed by the taste of the pork.Naturally, we couldn't skip dessert, and the TN Bombe caught our eye. Some of the best peach ice cream I've had on a base of buttermilk cake encased in Italian meringue with a slight char from flames. Despite our full stomachs, we polished that baby off in no time.The one glitch in our visit was our server. He seemed to disappear for stretches, and it took him an inordinately long time to bring the glass of wine I ordered after finishing my cocktail. I witnessed one of the other servers being much more attentive to his table, answering questions, and engaging with the customers, and I wished that he would switch with our server. I'm not sure if our server was simply inexperienced or having an off night.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Full disclosure here, my wife works for the hotel in which this fine restaurant resides.  That said, I always strive to provide unbiased and fun reviews and I intend to do so here.So, Mason's.  Ever wonder what cool looks like?  Well look no further.  Mason's does something that so many new Nashville eateries have failed to do: be cool without screaming it from the roof tops.  The whimsy of its theme is immediately apparent when you first arrive, with the different mason jars turned into lights and wall treatments.  That's not where the fun ends, as the food has fun playing with french takes on very southern foods.Lets talk about the service.  I have been twice now for the soft opening.  Service was flawless in both the bar service and restaurant.  Our servers in both places (Ashley P. in the bar and Larry in the restaurant) were not just well equipped for their roles, they were also warm, bright and engaging.  They responded to questions quickly and when they were not familiar with the answer they asked.  I really appreciate that last part.Food was amazing.  Creative, delicious and colorful.  In the interest of brevity I will mention only a few of my favorites.  The Bone Marrow appetizer was delightful.  I love marrow, but this had an etherial quality I can't quite put my finger on.  The popovers are wildly good with their accompanying bacon butter.  I had the Fried Chicken Galantine and it was quite good, but what it sat on was divine.  A turnip puree that was nearly life changing and greens that were among the best I have had.    My wife had a Kale Squash and Mushroom stew.  It was sooooooo good.  I would eat that stew at every meal were I given the opportunity.  My wife also had a soup of Corn Bisque that was delightful.  We shared a delicious Chocolate Cremeaux that was great with an Almond Tuile and it was a perfect ending.In the bar, I had a twist on the BLT.  It was fried green tomatoes, bacon, lettuce and house made pimento cheese.  I am a pimento cheese fanatic.  If I saw a sign that said \"free pimento cheese\" across a room full of children, I likely would push and shove my way through them to get there so when I say this was good, I am not kidding around.  It was beyond good, it was awesome.  The pickles (okra and traditional cucumber) are house made also and are absolutely great.  If I had my druthers I would want them to have a little heat to them, but they are really good as is.  The crab corn dogs are fun too.  They don't eat like a corn dog, but they have flavor unlike much I have had before, in a good way.  Mason's is making their own hot sauce in an old whiskey barrel.  While I didn't try it on anything, I did have a nice spoonful of the stuff.  It is really good.  I love hot sauce, and this stuff has flavor and just enough heat to make it worth using.To conclude, this place might be the best restaurant in a hotel I have been to.  Better yet, it is now one of my favorites in Nashville.  I see it quickly becoming the new hot Power Lunch or breakfast spot and a destination for dinner.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My wife and I went for Sunday brunch yesterday at noon with four friend who were visiting from out of town. The restaurant was not crowded, the menu sounded good, and we had high hopes.The food was tasty, but the service was painfully slow with no apologies. Simple requests (cream and sugar for coffee, water for the friends who'd just arrived) went unfulfilled for 20 to 30 minutes. In fact, our server (who was maybe working one or two other tables at most?) disappeared halfway through the meal, never to return. The hostess closed us out by asking what everyone had eaten, then coming back to the table again to straighten things out, as she was having trouble remembering what to put on the various checks. Several of us were overcharged for our coffee drinks, but only one of us pursued getting some cash back, as we'd been in the restaurant entirely too long at that point.In short, no fault to the kitchen at all, but unexplainable slow service, given the lack of a crowd at the restaurant. This coupled with no apology for the poor service insured us that we wouldn't be coming back. We know Mason's is new, so maybe they're still working out kinks. Until they do, I'd avoid them for brunch.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Didn't think much of it...until we got there. It honestly felt like we were invading the hotel guests' continental breakfast space. It didn't quite feel like a restaurant. Maybe I'm just being too critical but who knows! ;)The atmosphere aside, Mason's has excellent food. We started out with the Deviled Egg trio and while the flavor was great, the portion size left a lot to be desired; they are very, verrryy small. For our entrees, we got the Lemon Mascarpone French Toast and the Breakfast Tacos. The French Toast was amazing! The citrus and sweet flavors were wonderful together. My Breakfast Tacos were great and had a little kick to them! We both got a side of grits (spicy!) and they had me wanting to lick the bowl they were so good! For dessert, my mom insisted on trying the Fig Pie because she had seen it in a magazine. It was excellent and the Pastry chef actually took the time to come out and say hi and she was super sweet! The service was great as well!If you go: VALET. Self-parking was a bit of a pain in the booty. I'd love to try Mason's for dinner, when there would surely be less hotel guests and more regular patrons. Overall, I would go back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We went there for the opening night for media, and the main thing that drew me in was the chef and his story!He made the most heart warming speech, and I believe there wasn't a dry eye in the room!  He came from a troubled background, and has struggled to make his dreams come true, and Mason's made his dreams come true!

I was a little disappointed...disappointed I've never been before! Never had too much luck with restaurants in hotels, except in vegas, but this one is pretty good. Glad I came here instead of eating at the show. It was all cooked perfectly. Staff was friendly and attentive. Food came out super fast. It was a little expensive but well worth it.

Music was LOUD almost too loud, but the room was filled with a mix of well-dressed business people kicking back after a long day and tourists who filled the cow hide banquettes and high top tables.House Made Cocktails were delish--except the speciality old fashioned (peach inflused I think) was out--and would not be back in stock for 2 days as they had to infuse the bourbon. I ordered the \"Front Porch\" which was a watermelon vodka cocktail, it was OK but could have a bit more punch.We split an order of the poutine which on paper looked delish, in person the bleu cheese overpowered the dish. I hear that on Weds. they have a $5 burger special that might be worth checking out.Overall: more than OK for a hotel bar, prices on par for what you'd expect in a high end hotel, but def. beats a beer at TGI Friday's next door.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

(They were not loaded in butter or pork fat....yeah for me). I look forward to sampling the remainder of items on the menu.

    "comments": "This is probably the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time.I'm no chef. I appreciate food for its own sake and would rather prefer a chef who knows how to pair foods within a dish and an entire menu instead of fussing around with ingredients (for the sake of looking or sounding important). It takes a true master to pull off certain techniques without butchering the dish by resorting to over-fattening or over-sweetening. I haven't eaten at enough fine restaurants across the country to be a snob, but I'm definitely a foodie.That being said, I was skeptical of this place from before I stepped in. Nice hotel restaurants have that distinct error of catering to the dumb rich guy who likes to spend a lot and be inundated with information so he can feel justified in his purchase. Gimmick and money are his calling cards. I'm not that guy; give me the best without explanation because you know its the best and I should when I taste it. If I require a fancy explanation or catch phrase to \"get it\", then I'm not a customer worth keeping.This approach came in spades from our overly kind, verbose waiter the minute he opened his mouth. From the scripted lines to the explanation of food and drink (\"the ice is one sphere so the whiskey doesn't get watery\"), everything was just so forced. It's as if their philosophy is to provide as many one-liners and cutesy items (wooden magnetic clipboards hold menus, etsy-style stamped clothespins hold checks) to make sure their customer \"got it\".\"All of this is going to be palatable,\" I thought, \"as long as the food is good.\"It wasn't. Of the four different dishes and four appetizers my friends and I ate, only two were good. One was downright throw-this-in-the-trash-now food and the others were bad to meh.Trash: stew. Seriously if I had made this, I would be embarrassed. The only flavor was tomato (which isn't even listed on the menu); shitake mushrooms had too many hard stems, kale came in large, chewy clumps, the rest of the veggies were utter mush, and the shirred eggs looked, felt, and tasted like rubber.Bad: burger. Farm egg yolk broken, completely unseasoned, no moisture (egg would have slightly mitigated this), terrible bun. I HATE doing this...but I had to dip it in Heinz ketchup to make it palatable. And the \"truffle\" fries had not a single truffle taste WHATSOEVER.Bad: steak. The $25 steak tasted like a teriyaki-obsessed mom had cooked it.Meh: \"Jars\" of jelly, pimiento cheese, and something else unmemorable.Meh: deviled eggs. Over-flavored with sweet and fat.Meh to Good: Fried green tomatoes. Still, this dish needs an identity (wait the whole restaurant does).Good: Shrimp & Grits. Flavors right, seasoned well, fresh shrimp.For all of its faults, this restaurant has potential. The room was nice, the lighting was appropriate, if a little dim (we saw someone 15 feet away using an iPhone flash to read the menu), the waiter was nice and knowledgeable, and the concept for the restaurant is one that could, even should, work. The tables and chairs were comfortable and all other items were nice, heavy, and really just right in the I'm-nice-but-not-too-fancy way.However, I will never return on my own dime to that restaurant, and if they hope for it to work on the indiscriminate businessman, their current menu needs major renovation. Unfortunately, this is not likely to happen, as I'm fairly certain their philosophy of coercion through superlative and gimmick supersedes an application (or at least an aspiration) to excellence in food. If this sort of restaurant remains, it points to a continued ignorance among Nashville residents and business travelers.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Fried chicken galantine was very tasty with these spicy collards that were unbelievable.  Not your traditional collards.  We had never eaten huitlacoche before so we ordered the tacos, and it didn't disappoint.  The mole was really set the tacos off.We finished our meal with chocolate cremeux for dessert which had such a soft and airy texture.  Whole table was pretty much fighting over the last bite.Loved the concept of the restaurant, service, and food.  Will be back soon.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

When I found out that Mason's was down the street from my hotel and I had connected the fact that the chef was on Chopped (a cooking show I watch a lot), I made a reservation. I was alone so couldn't try too many dishes. I had the pork chop entree, which was quite nice (I wanted to pick up the bone with my fingers, but made myself resist). My dessert was odd. When I got back to the hotel and looked at the current menu online, I figured out why: I got the wrong sauce. They put the lemon curd sauce (part of the blueberry dessert-more appropriate) on my chocolate+peanut butter dessert (\"Elvis' Dark Chocolate Cremeux * Banana Jam, Olive & Sinclair Bacon Toffee, Peanut Butter Crumb) Seems like a careless mistake to use the wrong sauce and to include at least one typo in the description!

We ended up getting called earlier than an hour so that was great! When we were seated, our table was kind of in an awkward place and pretty drafty near the door. They had no issues moving us. A+ for service. Now for the food...we ordered the crispy brussels, pork gyoza, yellowtail jalapeno sashimi, garlic noodles, grilled corn, skirt steak skewers and finally finished with pork ramen (we were prettyyyy hungry lol). Everything was delicious. The crispy brussels and garlic noodles were my favorite but the pork ramen was up there with some of the best ramen I've had. We also had two large hot sakes and everything came to around ~$50 per person which really wasn't bad for as much as we ordered! Everything was really tasty and our waitress was so nice.

    "comments": "This place... I guess I could start that it was an underwhelming experience. I came here in thoughts that it was amazing, reading the reviews, and on top of that an hour waiting time that accompanied our visit here. And what I came out with it is that this is indeed a take on Izakaya, and just basically becomes a money making because it's \"new\" and \"trendy\" sort of Asian restaurant. Oh please... Don't make something that goes along with drinking pricey and hipster. It's so ridiculous. Yakitori are small dishes that compliment with the drinks patrons have during their visit, and well this place well overcharges. Think of Yakitori the Japanese version of Spanish Tapas. Let's get started with what I ordered. I decided well, since we're in an izakaya I should at least try one of their Yakitori along with their ramen. We had a craving for Ramen, and since this place had great reviews I wanted to try it out. Maybe this place was really a gem? Or it was probably a hyped up place. We ordered the pork belly... and, what came out was one piece of meat which cost $5. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS? At least give me a couple of pieces.... Nope, instead it's just one slab of meat. Let's get to the ramen. Tonkatsu ramen that's $14, and what we get is just a way too creamy broth, not enough broth, and on top of that the contents inside the ramen is limited to basically nothing. I felt that they really know how to make money, knowing that people don't know what true ramen is supposed to be and then if it looks like it, it's good enough to pass. The noodles were also undercooked which just added to the disappointment.I've had better. I'm sure there's better options in Nashville. I won't be coming back here, and I definitely won't recommend to come here for any food. I guess if you're only coming here to drink it's possible? But, that's pure speculation. I'm going to stick with my pho in Nashville, and if there is a new ramen spot, I'll definitely check it out.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Personally, I found the pork ramen's flavor to be a little too strong for my tastes, however it was still wonderful. The flank steak yakitori is phenomenal, as is the pork belly. If you don't fancy alcohol (or are your group's/friend's designated driver), they do happen to have Coke products. It's not listed on the menu, but they do have them if you're not feeling adventurous enough to try Japanese soda. All in all I love this place and I drag all of my friends here when I have the opportunity. 10/10 would definitely dine again.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Not bad certainly and for Nashville (not SF or NY), very good Japanese place. I like their drink selection and ambiance a lot, but this place is spread thin on a lot of menu items and not total excellence in execution or flavor of any. What you get for what you pay though is excellent. The cost point turned this 3 to a 4. Their wagyu dumplings may have been one of my favorite things all night, I liked the pork dumplings too but not as much. Their Brussel sprouts were tasty but I've had great Brussel sprouts in many places so I'm less thrilled. Their garlic noodles were a little off - they should have bigger pieces of crab, thicker noodles and more simple flavors. This was too brown buttery instead of buttery garlic noodles and lemon/Asian esque crab with fried shallot topping or something to zest up. Their tapenyaki was fine. Beef could have been more tender, more medium. Shishito pepper and wagyu was good - a delicious combination. Wish it were spicier though. Pork belly was crispy charred but too thick and not melt in mouth consistency. Ramen at the end was okay - tasted and smell good, so no complaints but not awesome in flavors. Should have added black garlic oil and spicy miso paste.If it were not serving a wide range of dishes in a city with less restaurants like this, they could totally do away with the ramen. Bottom line - go if you need a 3rd night dinner spot in Nashville after two great or in between two great contemporary American places. Great value / experience.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "THIS IS NOT TAKOYAKI.I had a craving one night for some takoyaki (Japanese octopus balls) and found they were served here. Perfect! I had also been meaning to try the ramen here to complete my Japanese cravings train. Off I went with a friend for dinner the very next night. The area this restaurant is located in has its own private lot so hooray for easy, free parking! I could smell the hipster vibes as soon as we entered. So dark. Much mood. Great numbers of beards. Anyways, I immediately zoned in on the goods. An order of takoyaki and the tonkatsu ramen, please! Now for the disappointment, the takoyaki was just not good. It was way too mushy and bland with the smallest piece of octopus. It was painful after being so excited for it. The ramen didn't do much for me either. The broth wasn't rich enough and the different elements they had didn't give any interesting contrast. I much prefer some of the other ramen shops in Nashville. My friend, who frequently travels to Japan, was also disappointed in her meal. Needless to say, my search for takoyaki in Nashville continues.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "An izakaya is a Japanese gastropub. I had been to another in Austin (that sadly closed), and I was excited to try Two Ten Jack. We arrived a little after 8 on a Saturday night, and there was a 30+ minute wait for a table, but they had two bar stools open at the bar. So we sat at the bar, of course! Sometimes I even prefer sitting at the bar in some restaurants! Two Ten Jack had a great drinks menu: beers on tap, wine, sake, cocktails on tap. There was something in every category that I would have loved to try! My fiance and I ended up trying a couple of their beers on tap. There was also something in every category of the food menu that I wanted to try! We decided to avoid sushi for the night (for budgetary reasons), and I was too hot to really enjoy ramen (when will it be fall? GO AWAY, SUMMER), but we tried something from the other categories of the menu. We started with takoyaki - octopus hush puppies with miso butter. The hush puppies were beautifully fried and exceptionally tasty, but they didn't need the miso butter (the miso was overpowering to the seafood, and it was hard to apply to the hush puppies because of the thickness of the butter and the heat of the hush puppies). They were served on a piece of newspaper in Japanese, which was cool!We also got the garlic noodles (crab butter, black pepper, and kokuto), which were delicious. Very garlicy. Don't order it on a first date! We also got some yakitori. My fiance ordered the pork belly with mustard ponzu. I ordered the corn and avocado yakitori, because I had never had that type of vegetable cooked yakitori style before! The corn had miso butter and insanely thinly sliced horseradish on top. It looked like Mexican corn, but rather than mayo and cheese, it was miso butter and horseradish! Kind of wild. The avocado was a half of an avocado served in the skin (with a cute little spoon to scoop it out) with mustard ponzu and wasabi. Simple and delicious. We liked everything we ordered - next time we go, we'd try all new items! Can't wait to try the ramen and sushi! The decor and atmosphere is pretty amazing. You walk in and everything is wood and lamps and darkly lit and moody and...well, I'm giving a hack description. But it's definitely an amazing place. We'll be back! A unique spot with great Japanese fusion in East Nashville!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The Tonkatsu ramen had a strange, gingery, almost fruity flavor to the broth and the meat. The broth wasn't satisfyingly fatty the way you'd hope for Tonkatsu ramen.

    "comments": "The crowd and place boasts a big game, but the price overshadows the pride they have in their food. The atmosphere is alluring. It maintains the dark atmosphere that exists in the izakayas in Japan. A good place to drink after work with some buddies, as is also common in Japan. The waiter was well-prepared to provide the long speech on the courses and food offered. He appeared very knowledgeable in the menu and was very attentive to our needs the entire night. Our table managed two cocktails, two tonkatsu ramens, one order of the pork belly, and one octopus salad. The pork belly was glorious, but adorably tiny. It was juicy and the sauce was amazing. I wanted more of it. However the price tag attached to it was absolutely ridiculous. I was staring at the menu trying to decide whether or not to order three things on a stick that would roughly total approximately $15 for food that wouldn't last 10 minutes on a plate. I wasn't a fan of the octopus salad at all. The tonkatsu ramen was good, but wasn't anything special. The boys both paid extra for the spicy miso. *A tip for others: if you like \"a little extra kick,\" share one order of the spicy miso amongst the entire table. Both our table and the one next to us was complaining about having one portion to themselves. One serving is enough for your table. Trust me. Best food of the night: the pork belly. I am admittedly a bit of a Japanese food-snob, but found this place relatively unremarkable. I was visiting Nashville and came to realize that Japanese food is hard to come by in Tennessee, and can see why this place would be a hit. I'm overall unimpressed with the food here and find the prices to be a bit inflated. Watch out for the prices of the cocktail drinks. Good service, decent food, cool atmosphere earns this place a solid three stars.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "At the risk of writing too many five star reviews lately, I really must give Two Ten Jack 5 stars! We go here regularly, and I have never had a bad experience. They make great cocktails, and it is great for a date night or a night with friends. I love the decor, service, and general ambiance of the place. And while this might sound ridiculous, I appreciate the large parking lot because so many places in Nashville are difficult to get in and out of. Two Ten Jack is conveniently located in one of my favorite shopping centers off Eastland. You can walk into a shop while waiting for a table or to grab a coffee or ice cream after dinner.Now on to the food! The #1 thing you must order is the brussel sprouts appetizer. You don't like brussel sprouts, you say? Well I thought the same thing about a year ago when I first tried them here. This place totally changed my mind on them. They are the best brussel sprouts I've ever had!  The Ramen is also a must. I have tried both the pork and chicken, but chicken is probably my favorite.

The brussel sprouts had the right crispiness, the sauce that came with the JFC was a great addition, and the ramen wasn't too salty. Beware: the wait can take a while.

We asked how long the wait was for two and they gave us an hour and 20 minutes. We figured we'd grab a drink and wait it out. Within less than 7 minutes they texted saying our table was ready. It was a communal table but it was no big deal to us and we were seated right away. We ordered the brussel sprouts which were great. A little sauce heavy for me but my boyfriend liked it and we also got the wagyu gyoza which were really yummy. The ramen (tonkotsu) was obviously the star. Lots of noodles cooked perfectly and great amount of toppings. The soup was thick, tasty, with a hint of spicy. Coming from Los Angeles and eating ramen at the best places sometimes more than once a week, I was nervous to have ramen in Nashville. Two ten jack wasn't the best ramen I've had but I'll definitely be back! It hit the ramen spot and was a little different than back out west which made it interesting. Vibe of restaurant was great.

Each plate is small, but they're all made to share so you can try a large amount of items. Me being the horrible decision maker that I am, it's a perfect set up for me. Okay so... to start the night off, the wait was estimated at 2 hours. I'm pretty patient and also there was a Mexican place near by to get a small appetizer and a drink. Win-win. Except the two hour wait was only 45 minutes. Excited we didn't have to wait but also had a half full beer. Cut my losses. We were seated at the community table. They're always hit or miss. Not the best company around this date (other than the adorable guy across from me). Food: so we started off with the JFC, my boyfriend loved it. I liked it. I'd likely try something. Different next time but the dipping sauce it came with was amazing. Second course we did a sushi roll. It was good but a lot of better options for sushi in Nashville. I'd likely skip sushi next time and try the yakitori. Third course: garlic noodles. My oh my. Delicious. I don't feel like I need to say anything else about them. But seriously, order these. Ramen: we went with the pork broth one. I read the most positive reviews about this one. And it was delicious. I literally could just drink the broth and be happy about life. Except everything floating in the broth, little bites of happiness. Definitely need that in my life again. To top the night off... wine. Always. I did the red dupeuble. The server recommended it chilled, weird for a red but I went with her suggestion. She was totally right, seriously so much better. So this place, date night success. I for sure want to come back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They have an area in the back where you can reserve two tables that could hold about 20 people. So seems like a nice spot for a relaxed birthday gathering with close friends. I've already been twice and plan on going back again!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Recommended: J.F.C and salmon nanbanzukeThe JFC is one of its kind imo. The spices on the chicken is refreshing. It's not the crispy kind but it's delicious nonetheless. The mayo is mixed with celery (?) which makes it even more fresh in terms of taste and aroma.Salmon nanbanzuke is stunning when you dip the salmon into the sauce. The sauce is vinegar based and it works really well with salmon. There's a hint of chili pepper in the sauce that spice up your taste bud. The match between the salmon and the sauce is wonderful. We tried pork belly yakitori, tonkotsu ramen, and tori paitan shoyu ramen. The pork belly is above average. Not too greasy, slightly seasoned. Good texture. Tonkotsu ramen is the better of the two. The soup base has a great texture but the taste is a bit on the dull side. The tori paitan shoyu ramen is okay. I like the noodle texture. The soup is too plain, on the salty side. There's a lack of identify. I would come back for the appetizers but not for the ramen.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

When this place first came on the scene it seemed a bit pretentious to me, and the wait times were ridiculous. 90 minutes seemed a bit excessive. So I ate at the other ramen place that I love called Otaku. Finally after all this time, I was able to eat here with friends. The wait time was quoted to us as being 25 minutes. Which was a lot better. It was very much so, when after 9 minutes, they called for us to be seated. Bonus. I wanted sushi and ramen. Because I wanted to get a good range. I had mackerel, and salmon nigiri and the tonkutsu ramen. I asked for chili oil, on the side. The atmosphere is nice. They do need to dial back the \"trendy\" music though. If you were to  type in \"hipster restaurant\" in spotify, thats the music you would hear. Its like downtempo Thievery Corporation suff circa 2001 or something. The food was really good. I ate just about as much as I could eat. They even asked if I wanted more noodles and of course I said yes. Its what pushed me into Man vs. food territory. The chili paste went down very well. Love the spice and heat. And I loved adding it myself. The pork (bacon) was a bit undercooked and soft, but I still had no problem eating it. Its become a new favourite. Change up the music a little, and you have a total winner.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I typically start off with a great cocktail on tap, the number 1 & number 2 are my go-to, but last night I tried a bourbon cocktail, the name slips my mind. Although they're known for their Ramen, I've only gotten that twice. I typically have the Brussels Sprouts, Shishito Peopers, and Garlic Noodles. The Yakitori skewers are awesome little as well. By the way, service is always is friendly & knowledgeable & the vibe is great! Looking forward to my next visit!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

DELICIOUS!The only thing I can say was not awesome was the presence of flies on the patio. But it is not the restaurant's fault.

    "comments": "I've heard so much about this place and I truly wanted to love it, but instead I barely liked it. Cute restaurant in East Nashville, but I was overall underwhelmed. Starting first with the fact that they weren't very welcoming upon arrival. We out our names down and every time we asked where we were the hostess just kept repeating \"you're near the top of the list\" but gave no approx time. I sat there and listened to her same the same thing to every person that come to ask. Hmmm, not a great start. We get seated and order... we order ramen, garlic noodles, Brussel sprouts, and some yakitori... everything was super salty. Eeeek, I was pounding that water like I was in the Sahara desert. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but so salty I couldn't eat more than a few bites without desperately searching for H2O.  With that being said, my friend enjoyed the food... for me, it was too rich. So we asked for a couple boxes, and the waitress looked at as like we were crazy. She's like \"Ramen can not be taken to go\" and we're like \"we know, we read it on your menu.\" We want it for our other items... she was not happy about that and begrudgingly brought us 2.  But wait, there is more. Remember I mentioned that my friend liked the place... a few days later we had a concert to get to and she wanted to order for pick up. And wouldn't you know... they don't allow pick up orders. This place was almost good. But their customer service needs some serious work. And pleeeease lighten up on that darn salt... hypertension is def on the menu here.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The parking lot is also large and there is also parking in the back because this place gets busy super quickly. I highly recommend getting a reservation. Overall, the food is pretty overpriced and the portion sizes are not that large. However the food here is fabulous. We ordered the JFC (Japanese fried chicken) as an appetizer. The JFC tastes way better than KFC and luckily the chicken is boneless and tender. In addition, we got the volcano roll and the east side fish roll. Both rolls tasted really good and did not have an overly aggressive amount of sauce. Unfortunately you don't get many pieces of sushi per roll so if you are a big eater definitely order extra! Lastly, we had to try the ramen here because the ramen is legendary. We got the pork ramen and it tasted amazing. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the egg was flawless. The only thing I would change about the ramen is making the broth less salty but other than that it was perfect.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was really excited about having some good ramen on a cold day. This was the lucky winner to feed my craving. Sadly it fell short. It started out w/ confusion about seating the my friend and I. Originally we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. I went to look at the bar & the lead hostess or manager said they were cleaning a table off for us & should seat shortly. Minutes after being told about the wait. When I let me friend know, the other hostess sat another party at the table we were just promised. We then were told another 10-15 minutes after the lead hostess/manager swept the floor to see if anyone was leaving. Luckily some patrons from the bar were leaving. I much prefer to sit at the bar. I let the hostess know we would sit at the bar. The lead hostess/manager found us 5 minutes later to say as if she wasn't told by her co-worker 'oh you decided to sit at the bar'. Bad communication on their part.Once we grabbed a seat we felt the bartenders weren't really helpful or really engaging. We got there at a not so busy time so not sure why this was. We ordered some drinks & then some food. Bartenders weren't actually really engaging w/ anyone from what I noticed. When the food came the server didn't bother to look at the bowl the ramen was served in. The bowl was chipped in numerous places. Because of the service we had already received, I figured just suck it up so I just spun the bowl around to the non-chipped side I ate my ramen. The ramen, Tonkotsu (pork broth / chashu / menma / kikurage / burnt garlic oil / soft egg) wasn't anything special. No flavors that jumped out at me. No one came to check on us to see if we needed anything or if the food was okay throughout the course of our meal. I'd say the service was below what I've experienced elsewhere. We were charged $10 for sake although on the menu it showed $8 for what we ordered. If the staff has an attitude of 'you're lucky to be here' then it's not a place I'd like to return to.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Mostly beer and house wine as well as a mixed sake drink.I got the poke appetizer which came out very quick and although it was kinda small it was really good still. For my meal I ordered 3 kinds of Nigri. I got the salmon belly, tuna, and the yellowtail. I also got a seaweed salad and a pork belly skewer to try. The seaweed salad is very different than anywhere I had but it was crunchy and tasty still. I even ordered an extra salmon belly Nigri. I loved all that I ordered. The prices are a little steep as I paid 70; tips included for one person. Be prepared to pay more than expected if you're going with a party of people. I am glad to have tried this place out as they're very good at what they do. I received my meal quickly and there were plenty of waitresses bringing stuff out.

The Takoyaki is maybe one of the most interesting dishes I've had in ages. The appetizers were brought out super fast and we loved them!The rolls we ordered took a lot longer to come out, not surprising given how packed the restaurant was.

Brussel sprouts were amazing, crunch and salty, an all around hit among everyone. Shishito peppers were good but a bit odd.  Some were really spicy and they had peanuts and figs with them.  I tried the seaweed salad and it was a blend of various seaweed, very good.

Our waiter knew what he was talking about in regards to the menu. We ordered the Japanese Fried Chicken, Australian Wagyu Short Ribs, Garlic Noodles, and Pork Ramen. Every dish was \"Go f*** yourself\" worthy. The food came out very quickly, which was nice. The JFC was kind of like popcorn chicken, but in bigger pieces. Great seasoning on the chicken, crisp, tender, and good sauce that came with it. The Wagyu short ribs were perfectly cooked and as with all Wagyu beef, very tender and flavorful. The garlic noodles were nice and garlicky with a great taste to it. The pork ramen broth was real good. Tastes like authentic ramen broth. The noodles were high quality and complimented the broth very well. There was pork belly in the bowl, which was well cooked and flavorful, but not too flavorful. Again, it complimented the rest of the bowl very well. The whole menu is reasonably priced. Combine that with the taste of the food and... go f*** yourself! I plan on making multiple return visits here and trying out the other dishes and sushi, especially the skewers.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Well it only took 45 min and we received a text that our table was ready. We sat a table with two other couples but that was fine even though they were pretty awkward. I'll take that over a 2 hour wait.Basically food comes out in small courses here. We started with the JFC (Japanese Fried Chicken) that I was crazy about! My gf wasn't as crazy for it but said it was good. I loved it. Next we got the gojiri roll that was pretty good. We followed it up with the garlic noodles that were the bomb! Strong garlic taste. Stayed on my breath for hours but totally worth it. We ended with the ramen bowl: tonkotsu which has a pork broth. My gf and I split all 4 of these and were satisfied. We also had drank beer and eaten chips and salsa right before... I know very unhealthy haha. But this place can be a bit pricy so splitting really helped the bill and we were both still full. Can't wait to try more here!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Fine, fine, it's just me. Ughhh... :) Anyway, I was there for a birthday get together - we had about 11 people. Reservations are highly recommended if you are coming in with more than 4 people. The server was friendly and knowledgeable. She answered all of our questions and our order came out quickly. I had the pork ramen for $14... which is comparable with the other ramen places in Nashville. The pork was thick and delicious and soup was salty but not overpowering.We sat in the back room and they projected Godzilla (the movie) on the back wall which was kinda neat.I would definitely go back and try some of the other dishes!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We started off with a couple of the signature cocktails: No.1, with New Amsterdam gin, Zucca Amaro, passionfruit syrup, tamarind, and lemon, and the No. 3, with Rico Bay Silver rum, Plantation rum, Aperol, blueberry sage tea, grapefruit juice, and orange bitters. They don't skimp on the alcohol!Then we moved onto food, starting off with shishito peppers with figs, sticky peanuts, and honey-soy; amaz-ing! I opted for the yasai shoyu ramen with vegetable broth, burnt corn, collards, benishoga, and mayu. It's one of those clean meals that fills you up in the best way possible.

It's good but the chicken meat is two meatballs... So don't get confused if you you are looking for actual chicken pieces in your broth. I have tried hole in the wall ramen places in LA and of course nothing compares, but for a place like Nashville where Asian food is not as great, Two Ten Jack makes the list.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

For starters, one thing I highly recommend is the garlic noodles. The noodles are cocooned in silky crab butter with a kick of fresh cracked pepper. Warning, these are highly addicting and you find yourself wanting more! Of course, the star of Two Ten Jack is their ramen. I personally like the chicken broth based but there is a pork and vegetarian options as well. The umami broth goes perfect with the soft boiled egg that creates a sense of comfort. The hon-shemeji, which is small Japanese mushrooms, adds a hint of earthiness to the dish as well. You of course can add in accouterments like chili oil or burnt garlic, so not one bowl is the same.It does get pretty busy and a little tight in some areas of restaurant, so make sure your timing is right. The parking isn't fantastic either but the food with be worth it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The lighting is pretty darn when it's late in the evening which isn't my favorite.SERVICE: pretty good, no complaints! Food came out SO fast.SMALL PLATES: meh. Takoyaki is definitely not real takoyaki but more southern-style hush puppies. Are Americans really afraid of tons of octopus meat packed into a yummy ball? Also, not a big fan of the miso butter. Poke was a bit strange. I loved the sesame/rice crackers that came with the dish, but the sour apple piece in the poke itself was a bit too sour for the plate. Tuna pieces were good. Too much salt, though!! JFC was a standard great.RAMEN: I did love the broth of the Tonkatsu ramen. YUM. You can order a second serving of noodles to your ramen as a add on! I like my noodles on the soft side, some people like their noodles on the hard side, and the ramen here favors those who like it on the hard side. Ok, the broth is what really makes the ramen delicious. I'd definitely come to Two Ten Jack for my Nashville ramen cravings.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The restaurant itself is on the smaller side but seemed to have had plenty of room at the bar. Had a really cool Japanese-pub feel to it. Our waiter, Alex, was SO helpful in deciphering the menu. I got the Japanese whiskey flight and my fiancé got the saki punch. We both loved them. The garlic noodles are life changing (could have had 2 bowls myself) and the octopus hushpuppies were super light and mouthwatering. Can't forgot about those Krispy Brussels (WAY BETTER than you'd think they'd be.)Every skewer there was to die for but you'd totally be missing out if you didn't get a bowl of ramen. It's nothing like the cheap stuff you had in college. It's just out of this world.  10 out of 10 would go again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The food was not bad per se, but it was not good. I can make better ramen at my house just by dressing up a pack of instant noodles. I know I am vegetarian but I have had better vegetarian ramen elsewhere. The kicker would have to be the price and portion size. For $13, I expect to get more and not leave still hungry.

The shrimp roll terrible.  Here is what lost me,  you spend 14 15 bucks on ramen and they set a rule that you can't take it home or Togo Bc they don't think it will taste as good.  Restaurants with rules drive me nuts.  Don't take your guests for granted Bc tomorrow is not guaranteed.  If we buy it we deserve to take our leftovers home.  As for the flavor is was decent, the noodles are basic and the broth was oily.   Btw , they open for dinner at 5 not 4pm.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's a bit difficult to find, as it's in a plaza area and the addresses aren't obvious. Walk towards the back of the plaza and it's on your left hand side with an outside patio. The hostess wasn't too happy when she greeted us, but that's cool. Perhaps she was tired. We were starving after a long day and immediately started ordering. Everything looked so good, but not everything was delicious. Yellowtail and jalapeno sashimi: fish tasted a bit too fishy and chewy. Pass.Salmon sushi: delish and very good quality. Yellowtail sushi: my friend said this was much better than the yellowtail sashimiWagyu shortrib yakitori: best dish of the night! The beef was perfectly cooked and not chewy at all. Chicken ramen: meh, this was just okay. Too salty for me and I wasn't fond of the thicker noodles. The soft boiled egg was a redeeming factor. Pork ramen: my friend ordered this and I only had a taste of the broth. It was so much better than the chicken!! It also came with the thinner noodles that I would have preferred. Service was pretty good, as we got served by three different waiters. I was a bit disappointed when we tried to order another round of the beef skewers because the kitchen closed at 10 pm on the dot. Wish they had given us some kind of notice. I would recommend this place if you're in the area. Get the pork ramen, beef skewers and sushi!

    "comments": "I left this place feeling satisfied, but unimpressed for all of the hype it gets. The ramen was good, but not that good and they do not let you take it home if you can't finish. I get that they want their food to be enjoyed as they intend it, but come on. It is just wasteful to make people throw out their food. We also got an order of takoyaki and Japanese Fried Chicken to share which were both pretty good, but not the best I have had. Overall, I think this is a really cool restaurant that maybe is a little too into itself to be a place I would want to go to any more than every once in a while.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Two Ten Jack may be my favorite Nashville restaurant.  The ambiance, service, and food are all top notch. Some of my favorite non-ramen dishes are the JFC, skirt steak and asparagus yakitori, and the amazing Gojira sushi roll.  For ramen, I have always ordered the Tori Paitan (chicken), but I have tried the pork and veggie ramen and they are delicious too.It's not the cheapest of places, but I will gladly spend a bit more for a dining experience of this caliber.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My friends and I parked very quickly outside the restaurant and headed in. I was very excited to try an East Nashville restaurant, this would be my first one.The inside was bustling as you can tell with the long wait and very dim. This is the kind of atmosphere I like so I was pretty amped for the food.We put down our name and the hostess told us it'd be a 45 min wait for 4 of us. We went to the bar and found seats easily for all of us. I'm from Michigan so when I saw founders on the list of beers on tap, I had to get it. I enjoyed an appetizer of sake tataki which was deliciously seared salmon. We were seated within 20 min of sitting at the bar in a very comfortable booth that encased us. Tonkotsu was the first item on the menu for ramen and I went with that. The broth was creamy and very flavorful, the noodles were well-made and made in-house so that was very good with the broth. I also asked for extra chili oil on the side which was really good. The meal was great, and they have kae-dama for extra noodles, but I didn't leave enough broth unfortunately. I asked for the noodles a little too soon and they took it off my bill which I was very grateful for. My company had the tori paitan which already had chili oil in it and I actually liked her broth more than mine and eventually finished her bowl. We shared pistachio mochi afterwards which was a little tougher than good mochi I've had before, but the waiter said the mochi was made by a dude in Hawaii so that's cool. Head down to Jeni's down the street in the same plaza if you're preferring a more American dessert\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

A friend of our ordered the Soba Noodle app for $9 and I kid you not it was MAYBE 3/4 of a cup.I am a past chef and have multiple years in the culinary world under my belt. The ingredients used were NOT that expensive and it was a complete rip off.Same can be said for the other items ordered before our dishes.My fiancé ordered the chicken ramen and I ordered the pork ramen.His tasted like dirty bath water and mine tasted like pure rendered pork fat.Needless to say, after an extremely expensive dinner that was supremely lack luster we left disappointed. Yet, because of my culinary background we always give a restaurant two chances.Second time and other TINY overly priced items later, it was the same conclusion.I will say their tea list is exceptional. Save your money. You will leave hungry and confused as to how your bill is over $30 a head.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The food is incredible but the front of house service is terrible. Everyone we've ever dealt with has been rude and incompetent. For example, last night we had a 45 minute wait so we walked next door to get a drink and when we received a text saying our table would be ready in 5 minutes we closed out and walked back over. We got back in 8 minutes and they had given our table to someone else and the hostess had no problem loudly telling us it was our fault for not arriving back on time, saying we didn't let them know we were coming back. When we asked if we were supposed to text back saying on our way she just kept repeating \"we didn't know if you were coming back\". What establishment doesn't wait an extra couple of minutes? I know they're busy but that is ridiculous. Working in the service and customer service industry for the last 8 years I would never dream of talking to a guest that way. Then while we waited for the next available table, the hostess told off another guest for not arriving within their 5 minute warning, and when they told her they had been sitting in the lobby their whole wait time she said it was their fault they didn't let her know they were there when they got the text and she gave their table away ..... seriously???We have an Airbnb walking distance from two ten and this is usually the first place I recommend to guests but I'm starting to rethink that suggestion. If you want great ramen and you're willing to deal with a long wait and the awful front staff then come here, if you want great ramen and a great experience go to Otaku instead.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Well, we had dinner at this restaurant because we enjoyed it so much in Chattanooga. We both ordered Ramen bowls(pork and chicken). I really enjoyed the pork Ramen, from the other location so I suggested it to my fiancé. She had her first taste and stated it was \"alright.\" I was surprised because I know how flavorful it was at the other location. She then asked the bartender( white female, jean shirt & blue skully) for salt and pepper. The bartender had to go to the kitchen for salt and pepper. The kitchen is slightly open so we were able to see her interact with the cook. He was stunned that she'd asked for salt and pepper. So once the bartender returned with the salt n pepper that was the last time she interacted with us until it was time to pay for the check. Did we offend her boyfriend or what? Chefs and bartenders should be able to take criticism and learn from those things and push forward. So, I would say the bartender killed the experience. She was rude and let her emotions show. So, yeah we didn't  catch the name, but would like to give a heads up of those who choose to dine at the bar and this particular bartender is working...please don't state your dissatisfaction with the food, because she will ignore you for the remainder of the night.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's a nice restaurant, I just feel that it's too pricey for what you get.The atmosphere, decorations, and decor are quite nice. This would be a good place for a first date if you're looking to impress with nice food and drinksAlthough it's touted as an izakaya, I wouldn't really call it that. Izakaya should not be expensive in my opinion; they're bars with cheap drunk-food. This place is pretty pricey, and I did not feel like the portion sizes were worth it. Quality of ingredients is high,but the ramen was all right. For the price, I would expect the best ramen I've ever eaten.I'm really sad because the best place for ramen in Nashville closed down.

It can get really crammed in here so if you have the option of sitting outside I would highly advise. Parking is typically not an issue but if the lots full you can find street parking.Food:This review is based on two separate trips I've had. One in 2015 and one recently in 2016.I thought the ramen was okay - some people will rave about it for days but I didn't think it justified the price.Sushi was never anything to write home about - again not worth the price.The main enjoyment I find out of this establishment are the small plates.The gyoza was always delicious, whether you got the pork or wagyu.I really enjoyed the JFC as well. Chicken was crisp but tender.The best part about my first trip was the Australian Wagyu Beef short ribs. This was possible the best Wagyu I had ever tasted. However my recent trip was not nearly as enjoyable as the last. The beef was a bit tough. It was very salty and not as flavorful as my original trip.Service:Service on both trips was great. I've been here with groups of 7+ and just a party of 2. I've never received bad service here.Overall:I'm hoping it was just an off day. Based on my first trip this place was a solid 4 - maybe 4.5. Its dropped down to a solid 3. The quality of the food was what justified the price. Now with the drop in quality I really can't justify paying this much. I'll give it another shot and pray it was an off day.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We visited Two Ten Jack (in East Nashville) on Thursday 03.10.16 for dinner, around 5:00 pm Central. We've frequented this restaurant many a times and thought ramen would be the way to go on a cool spring night. We were seated in one of the booths in the main dining area.Eats & Drinks - 4 out of 5 starsBeing that it was happy hour, we ordered a couple of 210 Sake Punches (can't beat the $5 price tag per drink). They were refreshing, but light on the alcohol (unfortunately not surprising considering they were happy hour prices) and were not well balanced (could use more sour to balance the sweet and ginger flavors).We ordered the spicy tuna and crispy rice app off of the happy hour menu. The tuna was served atop a deep fried encasement of sticky white rice and garnished with slivers of jicama. Who can turn down deep fried anything, right?Next we ordered one of our favorites; the crispy brussels. In our mind, these are the best brussel sprouts based starter in town (better than Butcher & Bee). The dish uses a blend of shichimi (7 spice Japanese blend) and miso vin which gives it that perfect 'umami' taste and results in you frantically searching the bowl for more.Speaking of 'umami', we also ordered another of our favorites; the garlic noodles. I like to categorize this dish as what I imagine might be Japanese soul food.  It's the kind of dish that puts you in a food coma. That's probably because it's a bowl of warm noodles coated in crab butter and sprinkled with black pepper and kokuto (a form of brown sugar). Due to the richness of the dish after a few bites the flavors are not as a distinguished. This dish could benefit from some pungency such as chives, spicy microgreens, or scallions (as we settled for). For our main entree we chose our 3rd favorite; the tori paitan. In our opinion, this is some of the best ramen in town. It's centered around a chicken broth base, contains chicken meatballs, noodles, veggies, and a soft egg. We understand that the ramen and broth are both made from scratch, in house, which is an added benefit to the authenticity of the meal. It's good till the last drop and a great way to warm your bones on a cooler night.As there were three of us, we also tried the yasai shoyu. This is the vegetarian based ramen option. It's good (has been somewhat salty in the past) and doesn't beat the tori paitan.Service - 3 out of 5 starsThe staff is courteous, but not necessarily homely. We were mostly engrossed in our meal so it wasn't as noticeable, but our waitress seemed to be missing in action a few times (refills on water, checking in from time to time, offering extra share plates, etc.). Nonetheless she was helpful when we requested a side of scallions.We've sat at the bar as well as other tables in the past and the service has been mediocre as well. In other words not service I can brag about, but not service that you can complain about either.Value - 3 out of 5 starsThe cocktails average $10-13 per drink. The small plates are anywhere from $6-11 per item, the salads and noodles between $6-9, and the ramen average $13-14 per dish. There are several other options (yakitori, sushi, sashimi, etc.) which are also meant to be shared. Expect on average to pay $40-50 per person with a drink included.Atmosphere - 3 out of 5 starsThe restaurant lends itself to a modern yet 'warm' feel. After all ramen (the centerpiece of Two Ten's menu) is meant to be a warming food.  In fact, they even offer you a warm, wet towel when you are seated. We haven't had the opportunity to visit during the day to determine if there is much natural light, but have noticed it tends to have a dim/duller look during dinner service. Though this doesn't seem to bother patrons and the energy and conversation is always at a loud hum.The organization of the space is a bit convoluted in our opinion, but does allow for many different seating options and group sizes. There's a semi-open kitchen, with an attached bar (the bar is on a diagonal). There's also a centered square bar (seating on three sides of the square). There's tables, booths, and a sectioned off room which can cater to larger parties.MiscellaneousThe restaurant is located in a plaza with other restaurants and stores so there is usually free parking available within the parking lot attached to these venues.There are no reservations taken for groups of less than 5, so make sure to arrive early on a given night if you want a table.  The wait line can pile up quickly.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been wanting to try this place for what seems like forever and finally got an opportunity to the other night. It's a shame I'm not in this part of town more often.Ramen is one of my absolute favorite foods. It's one of those things that disappointingly few people seem to have gotten to try a proper bowl of unless they live in an area with a relatively large Japanese population. So far the places in the US where I've been able to find it are California, NYC, and Vegas. This doesn't do me much good in Middle TN, so I got pretty excited at the possibility of adding Nashville to that list.So my wife and I arrive here in the evening and take a seat at the bar. The place definitely has a hipsterish feel but the staff were very welcoming and friendly, and incredibly attentive considering how packed the place was.I quickly became enamored with the short & simple menu. An opportunity to enjoy most of these offerings would normally require booking flights for those who have made their home in Tennessee. Shochu? Takoyaki? Yakitori beyond chicken-on-a-stick? Real ramen? I can have these things in Nashville? It's like Christmas where Santa was nice enough to grab me some bar food while passing through Japan .;So the bundle of things mentioned above that I never thought I'd be eating in Tennessee became my order. I asked for a premium shochu flight, some takoyaki, several yakitoris and a bowl of tonkotsu ramen because it's always been my experience that the pork broth is where you really get to taste the soul of a ramen house. I really liked how the shochu was presented with information cards corresponding to each glass; it was nice to be able to refer back to the cards for details while tasting instead of trying to remember a quick spoken description from a bartender.The takoyaki was a really interesting take on takoyaki. Very hushpuppy-like (which the menu says, but I figured they were just using it as a description of the food). It's what I would imagine the result would be if I gave a general description of takoyaki to a cook who had never had it himself and had access to a fryer but not a takoyaki grill. Don't misconstrue this as a complaint though, they were delicious! Definitely a classed-up rendition of what's normally a corndog-tier festival food. The yakitori was really good as well; grilled to perfection and presented beautifully. I think this is the first time I've ever complimented the presentation quality of a food-on-a-stick, but it's well deserved here.Finally they brought out the ramen, and what a beautiful presentation it was. The flavor was good but it just didn't quite taste like what I'm used to having out west and up north. Of course it isn't 'wrong' by any means, as there are infinite ways to make ramen. I'm sure it reflects the personal taste of the recipe creator, or maybe it was designed to be more appealing to regional clientele. All in all, This place alone is enough to make me wish I were in East Nashville more often, and I can't wait to come here again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been missing home's readily available and great tasting Japanese restaurants so I was hoping I'd finally stumbled upon something to satisfy my urges. Unfortunately it's very over-hyped. It's decent and probably one of the better Japanese restaurants around the Nashville area, but nothing to write home about.I arrived around 6:45pm on a Friday and the wait time was already over an hour for a table, this place gets packed very quickly. They also had a full service bar where it's first come first serve that is very packed with people hovering around those sitting. While waiting an hour for my slot to open, it was alright, the hostess was very nice with a pleasant attitude. When my name was finally called I was seated in the back at a communal table, not an actual table or booth. A little bit annoying as I put in all the time for a booth, but whatever, I'm hungry.It should be noted that this place doesn't follow any of the traditional Japanese restaurant motifs, it sort of picks and chooses individual pieces from different types like Ramen houses, Yakitori houses, and Kushiyaki houses. They are a bit all over the place and suffer from the old saying \"jack of all trades, master of none.\"To start, I didn't see any options for a hot sauce, pepper powder, Sriracha, or otherwise. This doesn't mean that it's not available, I just didn't see any on any of the communal tables which was disappointing. The hostess was very attentive and nice. She had forgotten my tea order but with as busy as it was it wasn't too big of an issue and brought it out shortly after I reminded her. The food was also delivered fairly quickly.Drink: Oolong tea - 3 stars.I ordered Oolong tea, but the tea that was delivered was a hot tea that tasted very much like peaches and potentially another fruit. Definitely wasn't traditional Oolong, but was told it was. It was still good and delicious but marked as three stars instead of four as it's not Oolong. Taste though was about 4 stars but it comes in a tiny individual tea pot. Whatever it was, still recommended.Wagyu Gyoza - 2 Stars.To me, this tasted nothing more than steak or beef gyoza. I've had other Wagyu gyoza in the past where you can definitely tell the difference in meat quality and taste, not so much out of these ones but they are still alright. At two dollars a gyoza seems a bit excessive for the quality meat used in these. Some-what recommend. J.F.C. - 3 Stars.This was your run of the mill Karaage, crispy outside, fairly juicy inside, but at the same time not very seasoned or flavorful. Nothing to write home about. The negi dip was alright, thick but very light, and again not much flavor to it either. Recommended, if you can get some hot-sauce and mix it with soy sauce for a decent dip it would be even better.Ramen: Tonkotsu - 2 Stars.As their most expensive Ramen option of the three, Unfortunately, the ramen as a whole barely fills half of the bowl they serve it in, which was consistent to all bowls I saw ordered. Though the pork broth was light, it was over salted. The noodles were also very thin and there wasn't much of them. The single piece of Chashu (pork slice) that was serve was the highlight of the bowl. Large, marbled, cooked well, and very tasteful.  Unfortunately there is only one piece and that really couldn't save the bowl as a whole. If they would sell a Chashu plate on it's own I would be all over it. Definitely not recommended.Tsukune - 2 Stars.Traditionally you usually are served three chicken meatballs on a single skewer. In this case, you get what is best described as a \"meat log\" on a skewer. It's a solid log of minced chicken and herbs/seasonings. The texture was fairly traditional and it definitely tasted like a rather traditional chicken meatball skewer. However, the outside was a bit over cooked which dried out the rest of the skewer. The flavor was still there, but the dryness instead of juiciness ruined what was left of it. Not recommended.Negima - 3 Stars.The meat was juicy and delicious but parts were overly charred again. Each green onion divider was literally black and tasteless. Recommended.Shishito Peppers - 4 Stars.These ones you could actually taste the better quality meat in, and the taste complemented the peppers very well. Definitely recommended.Skirt Steak - 4 Stars.This was by far the high-light of the meal tonight. Very flavorful, cooked well, not charred like the rest of the meal. Highly recommended. They only sell Mochi ice-cream for dessert. A few options, some unique, I went with the Irish Coffee as I never heard of it in mochi form before. Ice Cream Mochi - 1 Star.Let me start by saying, for a mochi order, you get a single mochi ball cut in half on a bare plate. No whip cream, other toppings or the traditional second piece as part of a pair. On to the main part, the Irish Coffee ice-cream actually was pretty good. However, the outside mochi wrapping was hard and tasted heavily of freezer burn.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Honestly, I want to give this place a 2.5/5, but 2 will have to suffice since Yelp doesn't do half stars. Having read many reviews on Yelp about how busy this place gets on a Saturday, we got there early, were seated at the bar until we were moved to a table. The ambiance was great - great decor and setup. Unfortunately, the bartender was the only nice person among the staff at the restaurant; this isn't to say that the staff were rude - they were courteous but definitely not friendly. They had a nice beer selection and a great cocktail menu; a little overpriced IMHO but great nonetheless.The food was good, not great. We had the hushpuppies, the sashimi with the chorizo oil, the chicken breast skewers, the volcano roll and the garlic noodles. I could write an essay on what areas the food hit the spot and where it could be better, but the bottom line is that the flavors were balanced and nice, but did not blow our mind.And this brings to me what I think was my major issue with the place. Back to the service. We were hoping to drink, try out a whole bunch of small plates and then work our way to the ramen. Our waitress kept showing up, which was initially great, because it was nice that someone was constantly checking in on us, but it got to a point where she came by at least once every 5 minutes asking if we needed the check. We'd already made it clear to her once we were seated that we were going to start off with the small plates and work our way to the ramen. How much more explicit should we have been? After the fourth (maybe fifth?) enquiry, we started feeling like we'd overstayed our welcome - turning as many tables over as you can in a day does make the most financial sense for a waiter/ress and the establishment, given how popular your restaurant is with multiple people waiting to get in, but thats just POOR customer service. Maybe it was just us, maybe it was a one-off thing but even though we really wanted to abide by their philosophy of staying at the sake shop, our experience isn't going to inspire another visit to this izakaya.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

But worth it in my opinion.  However, get a table unless you know the bartenders.   I eat there weekly, literally.  And each time the service is worse than before.  The bar manager does not even make eye contact as I say thank you for the water I waited 10 minutes for.  It's the same whether it's busy or slow.  The other bartenders have been ok.  Some have even been, *gasp*, friendly.  But I just waited 30 minutes, in real time, for a check.  And it's not the first time.  It's like the tenth time. Because I'm an idiot and keep thinking it will change.  The folks next to me arrived, waited forever, got drinks, and ordered food, before I could get a piece of paper from the printer.  Assuming it was forgotten we asked again, which was met with zero fucks given, and another 7 minute wait.  The couple on the other side of us asked for the check after our second request and got it, paid it, and left, all before we were even close.  Every time I go in there everybody around me is served there cocktails before I even get the water that acknowledges my existence.  I know how this sounds, and I promise, I've done nothing to mortally offend the powers that be.  I'm also a 30% tipper.  The service, and the attitude of the bar manager, just sucks.  I just want good food.  And reasonably attentive service.  I mean BARE minimum attentive.  I'd be happy.  But Jesus.  If I wanted to spend $150 and be ignored for two hours, repeatedly, I'd ......I have no idea what I'd do, because there is no normal or funny reason for that garbage.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Easily the best meal we had on our trip to Nashville. We came in on the later side of Saturday evening for dinner so there was no wait and we were seated right away. Our waitress was fantastic and answered any questions we had up front and suggested we order throughout the course of our meal trying different dishes leading up to a ramen main course. We started things off with Miso Soup, Crispy Brussels, and Gyoza. Everything was top notch but the Crispy Brussels were the overall winner at the table. Next we moved on to Yakitori. They have a ton of options to choose from and we tried the asparagus and bacon, scallops, and pork belly. We all seemed to have differing opinions on which one we enjoyed most but, for me, the pork belly was over the top. It was like miniature pork steak that had been marinated to crispy perfection.Next up was the ramen. Amongst the four of us at the table, we had all three ramen options listed on the menu that day (Veggie, Pork, and Chicken). Each large bowl was overflowing with goodness and were each their own hearty bowl of soup. The three broths were distinctly different giving each one a unique flavor. I had the Tori Paitan (chicken base) and couldn't get enough of it. The noodles were cooked exactly to the right firmness and then topped in a bowl of chicken broth. Topping the ramen was a half soft boiled egg, two chicken meatballs, cabbage, mushrooms, and maybe even more.Over the course of the night, we had a sampling experience of a good portion of the menu, fantastic cocktails, full stomachs, and we didn't break the bank. I would say it was well under $30 per person including drinks and appetizers. As a bonus, we ran into Chef Sean Brock in the lobby (award winning chef of Husk in both Nashville and our town of Charleston, SC). A fine indicator of excellent food. Thanks to Ben at No. 308 (yelp.com/biz/no-308-nash…) for the recommendation! I wish we had a ramen place of this caliber in Charleston.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our party arrived about 20 minutes early and we're welcomed into the bar area to get some drinks. Servers were quick and professional. Once we sat down to eat, it was game-on: Maki (volcano), spare ribs app, Japanese fried chicken, yakitori (hatsu, asparagus+bacon, wagyu short ribs), tonkotsu ramen all around, and finished with mochi. All of it was exceptional. The bacon wrapped asparagus was the best I've ever had. The tonkotsu was perfect and reminded me of the same dish I had in Japan. We had kids with us and they loved the fried chicken and noodles.  Two Ten Jack was a complete hit with everyone. I will visit this restaurant every time I come back to Nashville. What a treasure.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Went last weekend and we were a little disappointed. We have been before, about 5 to 6 times, first time was shortly after they opened and we fell in love. Never had Ramen this good and the yakitori was amazing. There was 4 of us so we tried quite a bit on each visit. This time we did the same but we were a little disappointed with some of the items. The Chashu Ramen was not as tender as we had it before and it was creamy, versus a broth. The \"handroll\" was really bland. The asparagus yakitori was just a chunk of it wrapped with bacon where before it was braided thru. Made it taste really salty. The other items we had were very good, Brussel Sprouts, Chorizo fish plate and more. I or we were just not as happy as we had been in the past. I still give Two Ten Jack 4 stars!! I will come back for sure. Just wanted to share with others that maybe have had the same experience.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Being Japanese I expect a certain quality from a Japanese restaurant. This is nothing like obachan used to cook.

Good start.We ordered the JFC (Japanese fried chicken), to start. It was delicious and definitely my favorite part of the entire meal. The 5 spice seasoning really took me back to my Asian roots. The dipping sauce was great also, definitely more Americanized, but paired well with the chicken. Then onto the ramen. We ordered both pork broth and chicken broth to try. I really enjoyed the flavor of the pork broth but found it to be too heavy. The condiments such as bamboo shoots, ginger, etc, really added to the flavor. Overall, a solid dish. However, I did not like the chicken broth one (but my fiance did). It was too salty and lacked flavor, it was too one dimensional. The best thing in the chicken ramen was the chicken meatballs. They were pretty tender and delicious.We also tried the shochu flight, with brown sugar, cucumber, and pineapple/ginger infused in each 1oz glass. It was not my favorite, and probably should have just stuck to Sake. In Japan, shochu is mostly used as a cooking wine, so drinking it really did not appeal to me (but my fiance wanted to try it).Service was great! Our drinks/food/checks all came promptly and the server was excellent at explaining everything. Great place to try something different, but did not wow me after all.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We loved our first experience here. We sat at the bar and went through the recommended progression of selecting something from each section, sharing each course of small plates. We ended with the veggie ramen, which featured the most delicious, rich umami broth and sweet, charred corn.A week later, we came back expecting a similar experience. They put us in this side room, an echoey, cold concrete box. Can we get some wood accents in here? Our server was fine, and the meal was good, once again. This time, we each ordered our own bowls of ramen after sharing a couple of small plates. We had some leftover ramen and asked for a to-go container so that we could enjoy it again the next day. At this point, we learned that the chef doesn't allow ramen to be removed from the building. Excuse me?Apparently, they don't do ramen to go because the texture of the noodles isn't as good. Sure. I get that. But I also know that when I get pasta to go or pizza to go that it isn't going to be as good as when it's right out of the oven. It's my money; let me decide what's important. Let me choose to make the mistake of letting my noodles get gummy. Don't tell me what I can and can't do with the ramen that I've already purchased.I also get that you want to prioritize fresh ramen for dine-in patrons, rather than gumming up the kitchen work flow with to-go orders. Totally get it, and I respect it. A leftover/doggie bag situation is different though because I've already purchased the food. You're just going to throw it away. Let me take it home and at least enjoy the broth and veggies the next day. Otherwise, give me my money back.I challenge Two Ten Jack to reconsider their position. As of now, it just reads pretentious and holier than thou. I've got news for you. It's just ramen. Get over yourselves and get some to-go containers.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was one of the best meals I've had in Nashville. Hands down, top two. We were offered five courses. They were as follows:1. Edamame and Tsukemono (pickled veggies) paired with a Lovely Rita2. Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi and sushi (a play on a Philly roll) paired with a Riesling3. Kara-age with negi dip (fried Japanese chicken) paired with the Death of Meiji4. Hatsu (chicken heart) and Australian Wagyu short rib with corn on the cob and miso butter paired with a German smoked beer5. Tori Paitan (ramen) paired with sakeHonestly, almost everything was a highlight. If I HAD to pick, I would say for starters the sashimi. Now this is how sashimi is supposed to be cut and taste. Holy moly, I was in heaven. I literally died and woke up in Japan. The fried chicken was fantastic, the miso butter corn was divine and the ramen. Oh my goodness, the ramen. Sorry Otaku, I hope you went and tasted how a broth should be made. It was tasty, not too fatty, and bold. And the pork! it melted in my mouth. I am literally salivating writing this review. Someone please send me a bowl of his ramen! The drink pairings worked as well, no complaints there.As for the decor and atmosphere, the place is slick. They really thought about the concept and made it come to life. I loved the lighting, the tables, the bar, the colors. Can you tell I liked it? Loved it!Based on the first four courses, I have high hopes for the place! I am praying that Chef Nakamura left his ramen secrets for Chef Benefield and crew to replicate.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

However, they won't allow you to take the ramen home. If you can eat it all, say goodbye. Frankly, if I want to take it home, I should be allowed to... She said the ramen becomes \"gelatinous\" in the broth. Im happy to have the warning, but I still wanted to take it - and she wouldn't let me. In summary, other than the servers telling you \"no\" and making you wait 20 minutes to order anything, it's great. Patio looks like it'd be fun when they open it...

Two Ten Jack is a Japanese-inspired \"pub\" (or izakaya as they call it in Japanese) that incorporates Southern ingredients. Although, I wouldn't really call it a pub by American standards... more like a casual restaurant. Anyways, their ramen is to-die-for. I always order the tori paitan ramen, which consists of chicken broth, tsukune (a Japanese chicken meatball - they give you two), collards, kinoko (mushroom), rayu (chili oil), and soft egg (which makes this soup spectacular). Just writing about this dish makes me drool (gross, but you get what I mean). It's honestly the best ramen I've ever had. I can't really testify to its authenticity, but who cares. It's great. The one thing that I wish they would improve upon is their outdoor setting. First, there are so many flies! The last time I ate here, my boyfriend and I were swarmed by flies. It's something that the hostess should warn guests about before seating them there. Second, they only have a few fans to keep patrons cool on hot summer nights. They're just not effective enough and I believe they should invest in more fans or try misting fans like they have in Arizona restaurants. It would really improve the overall outdoor dining experience. Otherwise, I highly recommend!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

No food is as good in leftover form! To be honest, the ramen wasn't very good to begin with. Broth needs more flavor. Too oily. Overpriced and average quality. The nigiri was good. Tasted fresh but small pieces.Doubt I will be returning.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Then I got the fried corn.  MMMMMMmmm, right?  Unless they use very short ears of corn, you get 1/6 of an ear of corn.  This restaurant could be the bees knees as it's pretty beautiful and in a great spot, but for me the food just fell flat on it's face.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Initially, we went for the ramen and ended up splitting one order of the ramen and then sampling the sushi and small plates. While the ramen was good, I think Otaku South is better. However, I think Two Ten Jack really shines with their small plates.Standouts among the small plates and sushi were the takoyaki (hush puppies with miso butter and the East Side fish roll. As for skewers, the pork belly, shitake, avocado, and shishito peppers were phenomenal! Cocktails on tap are a must try.The bill can quickly add up here, but we found it to be a fun dining experience and worth every penny.Can't wait to go back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Food is amazing - started with the JFC (Japanese tried chicken) as an appetizer, which was spicy and delicious. The signature ramen is obviously great.. It's nice that they have a vegetarian option as well, which I've never seen in other ramen houses. I tried this one and it was just simply delicious. It's a great stand out place in Nashville where it's tough to get away from Southern food. 5 stars!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Nevertheless, it was a nice way to kick off the meal.My girlfriend got the brussel sprouts on recommendation from one of her friends. We ended up splitting them, and they were fantastic. I don't usually like brussel sprouts, but these were prepared in some sort of broth that was absolutely incredible.We both got veggie ramen for our entrees, and I got a side of the quail eggs. I actually didn't enjoy the quail eggs that much, but this was my first time ever ordering them, and perhaps I haven't acquired the taste. The ramen was great, though and I left feeling pretty full (and hot - probably shouldn't have worn a sweater to eat a huge bowl of soup).Also - they have hooks under the table to hang your bag, which my girlfriend really liked. I agree that it's a nice touch.It was a bit pricier than we expected but otherwise, we had a great experience. I'd highly recommend this place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We ordered the Brussels sprouts which were good but were soaking in a lot of liquid in the bowl, the potato sticks, garlic noodles, and hush puppies were not great. The only items I would recommend, if going, would be the Brussels sprouts and the Ramon. We also had the wagu beef and chicken skewers, they were both ok.

Kind of disappointed that they don't offer some kind of reservation or call a head but I accepted the fact, and knew that it would be a late night. We arrived and were told about an hour wait, we soon found the bar and scooted ourselves to the seats as they became available. My husband was pleased with the choices of beer on tap and I was just excited to try a new Pinot Noir. We sat at the bar and right at an hour I got a text that our table was ready. I'm not a fan of having to share a long table that could potentially seat 8, with 3 other couples. But we sit and we eat. We ordered 2-3 small plates/yakitori at a time until we were full. After it was all said and done we ordered poke, wagyu gyoza, seaweed salad, pork belly yakitori, shiitake yakitori, cherry tomato yakitori, skirt steak yakitori, spicy edamame, and rotate sashimi. Every single thing we ordered was delicious! My husband said he could have order a couple more yakitoris, but was okay walking away not overly stuffed. We will be back, next time to try the ramen! We were very pleased, and will recommend Two Ten Jack to anyone!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

As excited as I am to have an izakaya in Nashville and have people, regularly, exposed to the awesomeness of Japanese pub culture, my food was a bit inconsistent. That said, what was good was really good and I'm happy to bring out of town guests here again and again. But, what excites me about doing so is the scene.I've never been to Japan but I have been to a fair number of American izakayas in food cities, I assume, know to get it right (SF, NYC, Chicago). As far as the lighting, hum and drinks go, TTJ nails it. I like the fact that it's a bit dim. It's not 'get your mack on' dim. It's 'I've had a long day at work and want a drink' dim. And when it comes to drinks, TTJ delivers. The drink program is well nuanced, interesting and accessible to all tastes. I had a hard time deciding on what my poison for the evening would be... but I knew I wouldn't be able to resist anything called 'punch' for long. Yes, the sake punch drew me in and didn't let me go. When in Rome... er, Tokyo, right? Truth is, you'd be hard-pressed not to find several drinks that didn't press your buzzer and ring your bell. After work drinks with friends + TTJ = win.Eating is a pretty good experience as well. I think you just need to know what to order. I started with the sunomono and it was a wonderful starter. Light and hit with the right amount of vinegar, the seafood (octopus and scallops) and vegetables (thinly sliced cucumber, and crunchy brussel sprouts & radish) married well to create a dish that made me feel healthy and worldly. Where I might have screwed up came with my choice of ramen. Instead of going fancy I should have kept it simple. But, I'm in Nashville, right? Chicken's a safe bet, right? Well, sort of. My broth was wonderfully seasoned and I happily slurped it and my noodles with abandon. Unfortunately, my tsukune was uneven. There's nothing not to like about (and, yes, I hear what I'm about to say) chicken balls except when they're uneven. My bites ranged from easy to bite to I-have-to-hold-this-with-my-fingers-to-bite-and-chew. You can guess that wasn't a pleasurable experience. It got to the point where I concentrated on the broth (the chili oil, egg, mushrooms, and greens added delectable depth and flavor) and avoided the protein altogether. My friend was going to town on his chashu so, maybe, that's the better option. I'll know for next time.There will be a next time.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Put an ENTRANCE sign on your entry door so the waiters or who I assume is the manager or owner don't have to rudely tell guests to use the the entry door instead of the door that the waiters come out of to serve the guests that are on the patio which brings me to yet another disappointing factor of this place. Guests have to walk through the patio where people are eating so they are very confused as to where to enter. I being one of those people. I sat on the patio bc I do not like community tables. When I go out to eat I want to enjoy who I am with and not other peoples conversations. I watched people walk away bc of how rude they were told to use the right door.  The waitress we had, not a good one. She kept insisting we use our wet towels and she would take them, well we weren't ready to use them yet and she took them anyway. Strike one! I wanted to ask so many questions about the menu and she would get offended when I asked about things as if I was interrupting her. Finally we order a small plate, it was ok but the portion was a joke. Then we order a skewer, while eating it, she try's to take my menu and then grabs my bf's instead. Strike two!  The food is very bland and I wanted so badly to enjoy this place but it lacked a lot of things including flavor. Finally we get our noodles and the only thing good about it was the egg. I was so disappointed about this place. I tried I really tried but the atmosphere of the place was just not my thing and it was clear they didn't want us there because we didn't \"fit in.\" Maybe bc we are natives to Nashville and they aren't use to that? Not really sure.  Won't be back so I don't have to worry about it.   Ps. To the 2 people wearing hats at the table, it's rude!!! Take them off!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The brussel sprouts and sishitos were overcooked and extremely under sauced and under seasoned. The takoyaki came out cold. And our ramen lacked any flavor whatsoever. We typically go to two ten about 3 times a month and spend over $100 on every visit but After our most recent visit, we are highly considering taking our money elsewhere.

    "comments": "I tend to look for ramen houses when I visit a new town, and I have to say, Two Ten Jack made my first trip to Nashville phenomenal. The red lantern and izakaya lamp at the front patio resembled those seen at the izakayas in Asia. They stood as a solemn quietude on the outside against the hustling bustling reality inside the pub, which to me, is a sign of professionalism: respect for both people on the outside minding there own businesses and inside engaging in making a lot of noise.At seven pm and without a reservation, the receptionist told me there is going to be at least an hour wait. He asked for our number so that he could text us when seats are available. However, my friend and I didn't mind sitting at the sushi bar in front of florescent lights and looking in to the kitchen, so we were seated within forty minutes. I was pleased when the server handed us wet cotton towels from a basket to wipe our hands with. It was thoughtful, and very Japanese (duh~).I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and a flight of sake called Intro. The presentation of the bowl of noodle was picturesque. The hanjuku tamago (Japanese soft-boiled, or half-boiled, egg) gave just the right touch to the whole set. What is true ramen without half an egg with soft yolk? Also garnished with bamboo shoot and other pickled veggies that boost the flavor of the pork belly and soup, a piece of pork belly centered, and a drizzle of sauce on the side, the ramen bowl was a feast to the eyes. Nonetheless, the spirit of ramen lies in the noodle and the soup itself. I would say, boldly from my experience, they were perfect. I love my ramen noodles firm and al dente, so to me, those were cooked just right. As for the soup, it was rich and even creamy, and genuine. I say genuine because I can tell from the texture that it was made from scratch: boiled and slow cooked to become the hearty broth with natural sediments and fatty quality, and not from soup powder. Opposed to others mentioning it to be salty, Japanese ramen soup are meant to be salty. It's the way it is in Japan and Taiwan, and I'm glad to have authentic ramen soup while on my trip in Nashville, Tennessee, USA.I could tell why people loved this place. Besides good food, the choice of drinks was amazing and the atmosphere against the Japanese rustic interior was hip. People were flowing in just to check on the bar area (not the sushi bar) and having a great time in an exotic surrounding. My flight of sake was beautifully rendered, from clear to pink to white. The clear was regular sake; the pink fruity sweet; the white stronger and smoother than the regular. It was a delightful chic drink that pairs well with any Japanese food.I told my friend that if there is any reason to come back to visit Nashville anytime soon, it would be for the ramen and the drinks at Two Ten Jack. After all, it is a izakaya (drink house) and ramen house.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The food was delicious.  Much smaller portions that I was expecting for ramen. We were assured that we could share a bowl as we had ordered two appetizers, but since those were tiny as well, we left hungry and walked over to Jeni's next door for dessert.  That all being said, I highly recommend the pork ramen (get your own!) and at least 1 app per person.  The drinks were delicious, but it was very difficult to get the bartender's attention.  A female bartender seemed less than thrilled about having to serve us.  I get it, cool hipster bartender needs to exude hipsterness, but really, it's your job to at least fake a smile and not bring us down.  That's where the 5th star went. I'd return, but I'd avoid her like the plague.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So I'd been hearing all the ramen buzz as of late and figured I ought to ch-ch-check it out   since my only ramen experiences involved Maruchan.We were greeted at the door by a very nice host, and there was no wait when I got there at 6:00 on a Saturday, which shocked me. We were led to a booth that was comfortable and roomy for the five of us. Our waitress was nice and relatively knowledgable. Friends ordered cocktails and beers that they were all happy with, and I got a mocktail that was deliciously minty and cheap ($4). I ordered miso soup, which was very tasty, but in light of my ramen experience, unnecessary. My friends and I got a couple of small plates to share. The crispy Brussels sprouts were VERY tasty, if you like Brussels sprouts (and I sure do!). The J.F.C. was alright, but nothing to write home about, and certainly not something I'd pay $7 for again. I ordered the corn yakitori, which was \"half of a half\" of an ear of corn, grilled to perfection, slathered in magical miso butter that I would swim in if given the opportunity, and topped with a small mountain of grated horseradish. I could've eaten about 4 more of them. SO delicious. I ordered the chicken ramen, and it was fabulous. The broth was so hearty, flavorful, and velvety! The noodles had great, slightly chewy texture and were much more substantial than the average noodle dish. I didn't eat the soft boiled egg, because I can't eat runny eggs...it stresses me out. Overall, excellent flavorful dish. I'd definitely order it again.My only issue with this place is the pricing! The portions are fine, and are in my opinion, a refreshing departure from the usual \"eat-til-you're-ashamed\" portions everywhere else. It's just that everything seems to be about $2-$4 too expensive..doesn't seem like much until you order multiple dishes (which is advised) and have a pretty expensive bill. I wouldn't order starters again, as I wasn't impressed, but the service was good, the vibe was decent, and the food tasted great, so I can concede 4 out of 5 stars. If the prices went down a tad, I'd gladly raise it to 5. :)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Lots of small plates with a Japanese fusion theme, sashimi/sushi, salads, skewers, and three different kinds of ramen (pork, chicken, vegetarian). I'm surprised to find this restaurant in Nashville.Crispy brussels sprouts - probably my favorite dish, and I tried nearly everything on the small plates menu. Chicken wings - crispy with a delicious glaze and onion dip.Yellowtail jalapeno - was pretty good with a nice sauce and thinly sliced jalapeno, but the actual yellowtail was sliced too thinly. Pork and beef gyoza - not good, filling was bland and the dumpling skin was too thick. Wagyu short rib - tasty, but not worth the price. A little tough and not as marbley as I'd expect wagyu beef to be. Salmon nanbanzuke - this was actually a huge portion, much larger than I expected. There were two large chunks of salmon cooked rare with a slaw with some pickles. It was pretty good but other things on the menu were tastier. Chicken ramen - the soft boiled egg was so good. The chicken meatballs weren't as flavorful as I hoped, but the broth and noodles were delicious. I only wish there were the option to add more interesting toppings. Pork belly skewer - quite good for those who like a crispy skin and fatty layer. We had a couple of vegetarians at our table and they found several delicious things to eat, including ramen, avocado/corn/tomato skewer, and soba noodles. For dessert there were mochi ice cream balls. I liked the green tea one, served very cold and hard.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We arrived at around 8pm, and were offered communal seating, but preferred to have our own table. This undoubtedly led to the wait time, but it was still surprising to have a 30+ minute wait so late in the evening. We found out why once our dishes were served! I ordered the ramen noodle bowl with chicken, (Tori Paitan) and a garlic skewer. We split appetizers of JFC, and garlic noodles.  She LOVED the negi dip with the JFC, and I was happy when her sushi arrived as I was able to snatch the Negi dip from her, and enjoy the delicious JFC!!! My wife had the Pastrami Hamachi for her main course as she is a sushi afficianado, which she liked, but thought it was portioned too small. As her sushi was quickly eaten, she began to liberally sample from my dishes. I was somewhat worried that we would need to order more, however as we traded the Garlic Noodles and Tori Paitan back and forth, we found ourselves stuffed at the end and happily paying the hefty tab. The high tab was in part, due to the generous tip given to our server for extraordinary service. She was awesome, and extremely helpful as we told her it was our first time here. All in all, it was an epic experience, and one, in my opinion that was easily worth the money spent.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

As this is only my second time ever to Nashville - with the first being a visit to Vandy in high school to check it out - I had no idea what to expect. Sure, I knew about the music scene, the country influences, the BBQ, but I'd only heard mublings about the foodie/art/culture/hipster thing. It was like I was in a nice, non-pretentious hipster-landia.The same cool ambiance, rustic-chic decor, and slightly unusual (yet still authentic to its roots) food - in this case Japanese. Delicious chicken ramen that reminded me of Katanaya in SF. Cocktails that reminded me of Rye Bar in Georgetown. Spicy hot pepper appetizers with the taste, but sans the burn-your-mouth spice. With figs. I loved this place. (And I'd share more details of what I ordered, if only their online menu would load.) :p\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Wow, I really want to give Two Ten Jack a 5 star review based on their food, but their attitude is just off the mark.Just for reference, I have been a ramen fan for over 20 years and I have enjoyed ramen from coast to coast in the U.S., and in Japan.The GoodTwo Ten Jack makes some really excellent food.  The Crispy Brussels are wonderful.  The JFC and negi dip is whimsical and delicious.  The Tonkatsu ramen is stellar.  Overall, you can expect really excellent food.The servers are attentive and generally well-trained in delivering the Two Ten Jack Story.  They contribute well to a generally excellent dining experience.The Not So GoodTwo Ten Jack falls short in how it has defined the parameters of its business.  It is an Izakaya and Ramen House --  both of which are informal types of places.  Izakaya are basically pubs and many of them have all you can eat or drink menus.  They are very informal places to hangout with friends.  Ramen Houses are generally small places that serve up great bowls of noodles in an almost fast food-like atmosphere.  Some of the best are even tucked away in subway stations.Now, in bringing these styles of Japanese foods to Nashville, Two Ten Jack has chosen to go for a \"Haute Cuisine\" approach that is really a turn off.  Further, their prices are really high.  In Kyoto, you can get a great bowl of ramen for about $8.00.Two Ten Jack tends to be light on broth. Ask for extra broth and they will argue that you will be \"ruining the balance of the bowl.\"  They treat you as if you are some ignorant yokel who does not \"understand\" ramen. The legendary noodle movie Tampopo created a Zen-like mystery around ramen, but I think the guys at Two Ten Jack took it too seriously. Tampopo was a comedy and a parody.Ramen is the epitome of good, accessible food.  Trying to make it haute cuisine and being condescending to your customers about \"balance\" or refusing to allow \"doggie bags\" is just not in character or good business.ConclusionI will go back to Two Ten Jack.  It is really good.  However, Otaku South is bringing some very good competition to the table.  And as alternate choices open up, there will be less reason to put up with Two Ten Jack's 'tude.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Based on food, service and decor this place is a 4/10. The food is really sub par. Everything I had (yellowtail jalapeño, spicy tuna, wagyu skewer) I've had somewhere else and liked it much better there. The service is mostly disinterested, which is a shame in a place with such a large food and cocktail menu. Decor is whatever. The most disappointing thing about my experience was the lack of health code recognition. While seated at the bar, an employee (who I perceived to be a manager) prepared raw meat in boiling water ON THE BAR. Right in front of me while I was eating. She wore no gloves. Then, to my further horror, she got out her iPhone and began texting. Without washing her hands, she then went back to preparing the meat. I immediately asked for my check. For that reason, I won't be back. I wanted to give it one star based on that, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it was a brand new employee with no sense about cross contamination or general well being. Cmon, Two Ten Jack. This is inexcusable.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Two Ten Jack was great and really different than what we usually eat around Nashville.  We were invited to go with some friends that are chefs and traveled to Nashville to check out the food scene.  They ordered several things and were really pleased with everything.  I also ordered a few things from the menu and pretty much loved every item I tried.  To start, I had the Japanese fried chicken (JFG), which was crispy and well seasoned.  The negi dip went well with it.  We had the asparagus and bacon, which was my husband's favorite, so he ordered another round.  We also ordered the skirt steak yakitori, and this was another where we liked it so much that we had to place another order.  The waitress suggested the skirt steak and said that it was one of her favorites.  My husband ordered the garlic noodles and these were AMAZING.  When I go back, I will definitely get these - although they were simple, they had so much flavor and were so creamy (must be the crab butter).  Finally, I ordered the chicken ramen (tori paitan) and added miso paste and chili oil.  Again, this was the best ramen I have ever had.  We ordered a lot of food but everything was so good that I tell everyone about it.  If you haven't gone... GO!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was really looking forward to finally trying Two Ten Jack... and left feeling underwhelmed--and not planning to return.First of all, when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand, despite it being the dinner hour on a Friday night... so we waited for a minute or two before stepping into the restaurant (our friends had already arrived), and then we realized the host was standing at the bar, talking to other staff members. Whatever... not a huge deal. I told him \"hi! our friends are already here...\" and in his lame attempt at a joke replies with \"no they're not! ...they're not here!\" I sort of stared at him blankly before he walked a couple steps and lamely gestured to the booth where our friends were already seated. Not a great start.We sit and review the menu before ordering cocktails (I had the No. 2--a tequila-based drink, and boyfriend had No. 2 and No. 3--a rum-based drink, I believe)--these were, above and beyond the highlight of the meal... the menu touts them as \"draft cocktails\" which is supposed to be alluring, I suppose? They weren't bad, but boyfriend said it best when he likened the draft cocktails to a bucket of punch at a frat party. Same basic concept, but the frat party concoction won't set you back $10 a pop.For appetizers, we shared the Japanese Fried Chicken (JFC), and the brussels sprouts. I was really looking forward to both, after all of the reviews I had read. The JFC was just off. It was like an overly crispy Chick-Fil-A nugget with some kind of mayo dipping sauce. Not to mention, the chicken itself had some sort of slimy texture beneath the breading. Not awesome. The concept of the brussels was good, but they came out swimming in what appeared to be a mix of soy sauce--the flavor was initially good, but overall overpowering.For meal, boyfriend ordered some kind of nagiri and a skewer--I don't recall which he chose, but he wasn't impressed with either. He had the garlic noodles on the side, which he said were fine.I opted for the pork ramen--a neat concept, pretty presentation, but overall, just an odd flavor compatibility. The pork belly ring floating on the top was difficult to eat, and the ramen itself was not flavorful. The broth wasn't bad--it sort of rounded it out... but all-in-all, the entire meal just didn't hit the mark. Especially when you're spending $100 on noodles and cocktails from a bucket.I really, really wanted to like this place, but don't plan on being back. When we walked out, we both said to each other, \"well, at least we know what we're not missing.\" That being said--the space was clean, overall the staff was pleasant and helpful, and parking was fine. My general sense of this joint is that they're just trying too hard.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Before I begin...definitely check out the Yelp reviews before going as it makes the experience much more enjoyable. This place is a bit on the higher side price wise, but you come for an experience and to try something new. Go with an open mind and wallet, and you'll be ok, I promise. I think what made it fall just a *tad* short were a few sub par dishes scattered in the mix. Just to get it out of the way... I was NOT impressed with the following:- We were a bit crammed in the booth (we had 8 people, so it got tight). But luckily they allowed a chair at the end of the booth and that helped us quite a bit having more room.-Potato fries. They had no flavor and the mayo based dipping sauce was bland as well. -Gojira roll - sent back to the kitchen as my brother refused to eat it. -Chicken breast skewer. It was burned, chewy, and didn't have a good flavor, all at the same time. Otherwise.... this place is unique and fun, and we spent about 3 hours trying a variety of food and drinks. Score! Here are the standout dishes:-Brussel sprouts-Volcano roll-shishito peppers-Garlic noodles-Chicken meatballOrder those items and you can't go wrong. I very much enjoyed the pork ramen, and they even stored my birthday cake away for us until we were ready for dessert! I love that! And if you want a cocktail... get the shochu & house ginger/pineapple tonic. It was heavenly!!! Overall, this was a very fun and different birthday celebration for me, and I would love to come back to try more off the menu.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Disclaimer: We only had the Tonkatsu (pork ramen) and beer, so this review is limited to those items. Tucked away toward the rear of the Silly Goose/Jen's/Ugly Mugs/Climb Nashville center, Two Ten Jack has created a unique space with a Japanese theme. It was pretty busy, even at 6 pm on a Tuesday, so we were seated at a communal table. The menu offers creative items, but I personally felt everything was a bit overpriced. $4-6 for one skewer of anything doesn't sit well with me. That said, they offer items that you won't find anywhere else in Nashville, so they get points for creativity. The beer list was pretty standard for the area, there were good craft brew options. The Tonkatsu was really flavorful. The broth was creamy, although a bit too salty. The pork was fatty and delicious. I definitely tasted fresh ginger, which was a nice touch. I enjoyed it very much, but I'm not convinced it was a $14 value. For two bowls of soup and two beers, with tip we walked out of there for $50. I'm just not sure it was worth that. It was tasty, though.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My roommate and I wanted to give it a shot, since we had a hankering for good ramen. We ordered the poke (tuna) appetizer and found it light and refreshing, a promising start. Also got the negima (chicken leg meat) to try some yakitori, which was pretty good. The main reason we were there, though, was the ramen. It turned out to be a huge disappointment. The tori paitan (chicken) had really salty broth, and it was difficult to stomach. In the end, we just ate the noodles (good texture on the noodles) and left most of the broth in the bowl. A friend got the tonkatsu (pork) ramen, and it was swimming in oil. When he set aside the broth for a few minutes, the oil quickly congealed in an unappetizing film on top. Definitely not worth the $14!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Japanese Fried Chicken is the only reason I come here. The rest of the small plates are good, but not worth the price. The ramen is standard and tastes good albeit served in an overly fatty broth. Nothing to write home about. They also will not allow anything left over to be taken home. The policy seems to be for quality control. Many ramen places invoke the same militant policy both foreign and domestically. This restaurant makes sure to let you know with the snobbiest of attitudes. Seriously, spare yourself the lecture about how \"most Americans don't know that, *smirk,\" just don't ask for a box. They also seem to have a bad habit of not serving the table's dishes at the same time, leaving some guests to be eating solo at the end of the meal. Their excuse, \"Some of your dishes are cooked at different stations.\" A poor excuse to leave your customers sitting awkwardly while their company finishes. All in all I think this establishment's biggest downfall starts at the top. There is an air of overconfidence that borders on rude, especially when I read other reviews that have been publicly dismissed by the management. The waiters seem to be quick and knowledgable, however not scheduled aptly because we were not served expediently. If you must give it a try, give yourself 3 hours, the staff will not work very hard to make sure diners are seated quickly or in a similar order in which they arrive.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So so so close to 5 stars. Like, ridiculously close to 5 stars.We're talking 4.75 on the 'ol Yelp star scale.The reservation confirmation was super efficient and professional. I booked our \"Girls Night Out\" dinner (reservations are only for parties of 6 parties or more) and our table was ready within moments of our arrival. Our server was super helpful and was very familiar with the menu - we opted to share some Small Plates that included the super savory Crispy Brussels ($8) and the Potato Fries ($6). I thoroughly enjoyed both very much but I simply can't stop thinking about those dang Potato Fries. They are the perfect blend of crispy, comforting, and spicy. I was literally getting edgy each and every time another friend from the table reached for another fry and wanted to smack their cute little hands away. We promptly ordered cocktails and I opted for the No. 1 and was dazzled by own drunken state after just one! The Broker's Gin, Cynar, Plum & Peppercorn Shrub, Lemon Cordial, and Peychaud's Bitters make up one of my favorite new cocktails in this town. Order it. You won't be disappointed. Speaking of my one and only disappointment, while our server happily suggested vegan options on the menu such as the satisfying Soba Noodles ($8) and tasty Ramen that I previously ordered at an Otaku South event last weekend ($12), I was very surprised that there was not a veg-friendly sushi option listed on the menu. They were kind enough to have the chef prepare a veggie roll for me on the fly but wouldn't it make sense to have at least one on the menu? Seems like something that they can easily do and I can attest that it does make a huge difference to us vegans and vegetarians who crave sushi without sea creatures in them. The overall layout and space is beautiful and I love the overall ambiance. The lighting is dark and moody but can get a bit loud (likely due to my table) so it may not be the best spot if you're seeking a quiet evening out or need to have a profound conversation with your dinner date. Overall, this is a fantastic spot to visit for dinner and/or drinks and I'd highly suggest that you at least give it a try, even if Japanese food isn't normally your thing. You may be surprised what entices you on the menu. TIP: Budget an extra 5 minutes into your arrival time to locate parking (especially on the weekends), I had to \"get creative\" and made my own spot at the end of the lot. There is also off-street parking but that can sometimes require a bit of luck or magic to score one.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I have always had good service here, but that is to be expected when I am paying $40 for a meal. The reason for my 3 stars is the fact that you are actually NOT ALLOWED to take home leftovers (if you get ramen ). This is so bizarre, and frankly, not ok. They claim it won't taste as good leftover, but isn't that the case with any food? If I pay for my food, I should be allowed to make the decision on whether or not I want to take it home with me if I do not finish it. I find this to be extremely condescending, and not a smart business practice. I think this place has a lot of potential, if they work out a few kinks, and change this policy.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated, which was pretty cool. We were seated at a community table, which I've had a bad experience with in other restaurants but which worked fine for this one. It was a beautiful night so being outside was a lot of fun. There's water on the table so you can refill your own glass when needed; the waiters will use it to refill your own if you forgot as we often did since we spent the whole night talking with each other. They tell you ahead of time that food will come out at different times, which we greatly appreciated. I was devastated to read that take-out/leftovers are forbidden for Ramen Noodles because of how poorly they taste reheated. The waitress assured me they were very filling and rather large, so I decided to split a bowl with my friend since we both usually don't finish our meals. It worked out perfectly. I adored our appetizer of Japanese Fried Chicken. The spice on it was fantastic and the inside was warm and tender and melted in my mouth. I actually liked it better without the sauce but it still tasted ok with the dipping sauce. Both my husband and I disliked the Tsukune Yakitori to the point where we didn't like it. My friend and I ate our ramen but we really felt it was lacking in flavor. It may have been because it was vegetarian but it couldn't be helped since my friend is a vegetarian.

So stoked to report that this place did not disappoint! We got a round of small plates + drinks. The Brussels sprouts were phenomenal. The pork gyoza and chicken meatballs were great too. Drink was strong, good and not overtaken by too much ice. It lasted the whole meal. Always a plus for a Monday night. Finally, the pork ramen was absolutely delicious. Rich and flavorful but not overpowering. I added the chili oil for some spice but honestly, it could have been a little hotter. But all in all, it more than satisfied my tonkotsu ramen craving! (Something the pack of organic ramen from produce place did not do). The service and vibe were on point as well. My only complaint is that the food came out at inconsistent times. My friend ordered sushi and she waited a significant amount of time without a meal, just watching us slurp ramen and taking bites. Apps came out at different times too. Not a huge deal for my group since we are all into sharing, but something to note if that kinda thing bothers you. Definitely the kind of place where I could have stayed for hours. I'm so glad this exists in Nashville! Can't wait to go back and try more small plates. And get another drink!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I recommend doing several courses and enjoying the whole experience. It's not so pricey if you have friends join you. The sashimi plates are very small but all carefully seasoned and presented. We really enjoyed the pastrami hamach and the yellowtail jalapeño. The brussels sprouts are really great and large enough for several people to share. I was a little underwhelmed with my sushi roll but my friend's garlic noodles made up for it. Finally you have to go with ramen. The chicken and pork were both delicious.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This was our second chance for Two Ten Jack and we'll never go back. The hostesses told us we would wait 20-25 minutes for our party of four...OVER AN HOUR later we finally got a table, after watching several larger parties get seated before us even though they put their name in after us. While we waited we attempted to get a drink at the bar, but the bartenders wouldn't serve us since we weren't sitting at the bar (two of us were, two of us standing because there was no room). Our waiter took forever and came by about three-four times during the meal. The food was decent, but definitely not worth the price and wait.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We like small plates and the casual nature (and ability to get in without reservations) of sitting at the bar in many restaurants. Two Ten Jack is a winner for us. We have our favorite things we order which are the salmon nanbanzuke, poke (tuna tartare), takoyaki (octopus hush puppies with miso butter) garlic noodles and pork belly yakitori. When it's cold the Hot Tadashi is soooo good (chai spiced bourbon with lemon and hot sake sidecar) and a great selection of cold sakes in the warmer months. We have tried the ramen and it was very good, but I actually prefer Otaku's ramen and Two Ten offers so much other places don't so we stick with their small plates etc.. never ordered sushi here, but we don't feel like we're missing anything!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So, our night at Two Ten started off a little rocky. We ended up having to wait a while past our reservation time to actually be seated, but they tried their best to take care of us while we waited, and that was appreciated. Being that they just opened, I'm absolutely not holding that against them. Our only other issue was the pair of pretentious night walkers that yelled at my friend for holding the door open for someone, because it was \"cold\". That just goes to show that a good bowl of Ramen will attract  even the lowest of life forms.Once we were seated, our experience completely turned around. Our server was very knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. While it is a little on the loud side, we really dug the atmosphere and choice of music. I could see this being a place I frequent, even if only for drinks.But how was the food? Everything we had was hit. We started with Spicy Edamame, JFC and Pork Gyozas. All were pulled off well, but the Edamame was excellent.The star of the show here is their Ramen, so I ordered the Tonkostsu(pork broth with chashu). The noodles were cooked well, the pork was very tender and the broth was very flavorful. The soft egg was a great addition as well. I love the fact that you can order extra noodles, which I did in advance, haha. I would appreciate a slightly thicker noodle and spicy option, but all things said, it was a successful bowl of Ramen. It reminded me a lot of Ippudo in NYC, which is not a bad thing by any means.Also, do not forget to order the Mochi Ice Cream, it's not on the menu. This is my only time having it outside of Honolulu and it's just as good as I remembered. Both the Cinnamon Bun and Azuki Bean flavors were great.After we got past our seating issue, we had a great experience. Excellent service and food. I'm sure they'll become more streamed lined up front as time goes by, as nearly all new places have these issues. Normally I wouldn't even have went to a place this new, just for that reason, but I'm glad we took the risk. I've been waiting forever for a place like this to hit Nashville, so I'm looking forward to many more visits.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My wife and I are huge fans of Asian cuisine, and had a hankering for a bowl of delicious ramen, which led us to Two Ten Jack. First of all, the service was impeccable. I rarely comment on the service, unless it's above or below average. In this case, it was above average. Every employee we came across was genuinely cheerful and kind. This place must treat their employees well, and it does make a difference, and it shows. If that's not the case, then they just got lucky with great people, because we were impressed by the service.We arrived right before happy hour was ending, so I quickly ordered a 2-4-1 Kirin draft, and their $5 special spicy tuna appetizer. My wife ordered a cocktail from the bar, a Moscow Mule, which she thoroughly enjoyed. The beer was delicious, definitely fresh. We both ordered the pork ramen, and the Japanese fried chicken for a second appetizer.The spicy tuna appetizer was pretty good. It was made well, and had decent flavor. Not terribly spicy, but tasty and a good deal for $5. The JFC, was also pretty good. It's cubes of chicken battered and fried, and it comes with some kind of mayo-based sauce that is reminiscent of tarter sauce. My wife wasn't crazy about it, and truthfully I wasn't either, but it was also made well and still pretty tasty. The chicken pairs very well with that sauce, and it comes with a slice of lemon that actually added quite a bit of flavor to it. I enjoyed it, but if we ever go back I'll definitely try different things. The ramen.My wife and I both had very mixed feelings about this star dish.  The basics of a good bowl of ramen -- the broth and the noodles-- were excellent. The broth was downright delicious, full of flavor, rich, fatty, meaty... The noodles were very good too and cooked perfectly.  Our only complaints about it were the chosen toppings. In this area, we were both pretty disappointed. The bowls offered plenty of white and green onions, then a smattering of what was either shredded carrot or ginger, another shredded purple veggie, a few bamboo shoots, half of an egg, an injection of black ink, and a very thin slice of some kind of prepared rolled pork.Two Ten Jack, I believe you can do better. First of all, the egg was the best part, and you only get half of one. They want to charge a dollar for the other half. Second, the slice of pork was the most disappointing part. It was very thin, very fatty, and didn't taste very good. I appreciate the effort to add appeal by rolling it, but doing that made it harder to separate the fat from the edible part. The other veggies were okay, but I firmly believe the toppings do the fabulous broth a terrible disservice. Just throw the bamboo shoots away, they taste horrible anyway. The onions and ginger can stay, but I think you should definitely consider other toppings to complement the dish. Maybe Some tender Enoki mushrooms, a better portion of pork belly and/or some bacon, the other half of my egg, and I would've been happy as a clam. We both enjoyed it for the most part, but unfortunately it just didn't hit the spot.Price-wise, I think it's a little more expensive than what it's worth, especially since it's mostly small plates, so the portions are, well, small.To sum it up, I'm glad we gave this place a chance. It was truly a pleasant experience, the place is clean and decorated well, service was impeccable, and the food was decent. Unfortunately, the menu failed to knock any socks off or blow either of us away, and I truly regret that. Because of that, I doubt we will make our way back. The search for that delicious, perfect bowl of ramen in Nashville continues.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

That being said, Two Ten Jack just upped the ante.We sat in the community table room and had Miyazaki films playing for the duration of our dinner. What a treat! We had two servers, one was just starting out, and they were both highly attentive, explained everything perfectly and extremely social with us. This is EXACTLY what I want in a server. We took the Izakaya route and started with the Poke and Shishito Peppers, along with a small hot sake. I have to say that the figs were a perfect touch to the peppers and the sesame chicharron added the perfect crisp to the Poke. Next we tried the Gojira Roll and it came out with a HUGE shrimp head that had the sweetest and juiciest meat, holy cow! SO. Freaking. Good. Then came the Pork Belly and Hotate yakitori. Both of them melted in our mouths but the Hotate (scallop) was probably the best scallop I've ever had. No joke. It was in this buttery sauce that just made you moan out loud without realizing it. Good thing the atmosphere wasn't silent... We ended with the Tonkotsu ramen which was too die for! There wasn't much pork belly and I was happy about that, seeing as we had just devoured the fattiest piece of seared pork belly with the yakitori.Everything was epic! I can't stop telling EVERYONE I know about this place! From the service to the food, we walked out of there pleased as punch. One of our servers even recommended a local bar that he thought we'd really like. That review will be on the No. 308 page so you should check them out as well.

That food though. Everything I've ever eaten there is delicious. With unexpected and inventive combinations, the menu proves to be like an adventure you didn't know you wanted. I highly recommend the Takoyaki! They are hush puppies with seafood inside and come with the most delicious miso dipping paste. If you have a savory palette these are absolutely not to be missed. If you go during the week you shouldn't have a problem with a wait. There will be a decent wait on the weekends if you show up anytime after 6:00. This applies to most delicious restaurants in Nashville on a weekend though. Also, this is meant to be more of a \"hangout and eat\" establishment. The intention is you eat and chat and then order more food. Your server will never make you feel rushed while you enjoy your dinner company. The atmosphere is to blame for the wait, the food always comes out in a timely manner. The plates are smaller portions because it's meant for you to sample and share a variety with your company. Again, it's a hangout and have good conversation over dinner place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They must give discounts to tattoo 20 something's musicians to keep the vibe real - but even if this place looked like a Waffle House and charged the same price I would go.A little pricey but worth it, a must go to.

The Japanese fried chicken appetizer with negi dip is fantasic, lots of flavor but that's where my positive opinion ends. I've never thought a dish was OVER seasoned until the hubs and I tried our two ramen bowls. I ordered the tonkotsu, which was pork belly based.  That broth was so heavy and fatty it made me nauseous .  The hubs ordered the tori paitan( chicken based) and while the broth was much lighter the chili oil over powered the whole dish. Two Ten Jack does offer a variety of other dishes that we haven't tried that might be good however. Experience was fun, service great but we are still in the hunt for a good ramen house.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The best thing we had was the white dipping sauce that comes with the fried potatoes. The short ribs were good, but you get 3 bite size pieces on a small plate. Thus, my primary complaint..... Sixty something bucks for several small saucer size plates of food and 1 drink each is way too high. Very trendy, nice atmosphere, albeit too loud where we were sitting, and a very congenial wait person. I'm not saying we won't be back, but we won't be back anytime soon.

So if you're just a typical burger and fries food person -- continue to read my review...I got NO.1 to drink.. which is some pre-mixed by them in house gin drink that was awesome. Sweet, fruity and full of booze.  We had the Poke and Hushpuppies to start. The Poke was my favorite thing on the menu if you like TUNA get this. I would return to this restaurant for the Poke. Up next the  gojira roll good, about 8-9 massive pieces, but nothing to blow my socks off. Then we got the seaweed salad. Good but different. Look it's probably REAL seeweed salad and my poor cheap ass has only had that cheap garbage from those other stripmall places. It was super flavorful but not flavors or textures I'm used to. Yakitori is like meat on a stick. Small stick with 2 pieces of meat. I get it. I knew what I was getting into. We got the Chicken Meatballs, super spicy, and good. Short Rib was the best small stick I ate. But it was still small. At the end of the day if you're just skimmin' through this tyring to decide to go to this new joint in east nashville the answer is yes. Its different, the service was great, and the food was very good but it's just a bit more expensive then your typical Nashville restaurant, but you get what you pay for. It's really good food. Great location for a date night! And they were playing some awesome old school rap while I was there. Different and cool. SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My experience with ramen is limited to that served by Otaku South, but I'm well versed in things that are delicious, so I hope that makes me credentialed enough to review Two Ten Jack.Now that construction is finished, the shopping area that houses Two Ten Jack is really a pleasant place to be. Parking is no longer a total disaster, so you needn't factor that into your dining decision. We only glimpsed the inside decor for a second because we chose to sit outside, but the place looked really swank. There was even a silent projection of one of Michel Ocelot's stopmotion-style silhouette animations, which means the person in charge of design has excellent taste. As an added bonus, Jeni's ice cream is just a few steps away, meaning you can cap off an excellent meal with an amazing dessert. The server started us off by saying that the restaurant was intended to be some sort of traditional japanese pub, where diners would typically eat several courses, starting with smaller ones and working their way up to a final dinner-sized something (like ramen). I heard other servers parrot this introduction to those that were seated around us, and I have to say, I found it annoying. It was as though they were saying, \"Welcome to our restaurant. If you would like an authentic experience, please order one of everything from the menu.\" It sort of left us feeling like the American assholes that just came for ramen.But we did actually order a smaller plate of sashimi, because it caught our eye. The pastrami hamachi ($10) is topped with mustard roe and rye olive oil, and it is, in a word, incredible. The fresh white fish was the perfect canvas for these bolder unexpected flavors.We then got what we came for, ramen. My husband ordered the tonkatsu ($14) and I ordered the tori paitan ($13). Both soups had incredible depth of flavor. The chicken meatballs in my soup were deliciously bright (were there notes of citrus and ginger?). The broth in my husband's tonkatsu was rich, but not too heavy. The noodles were perfectly chewy. It was delicious.Still despite being thoroughly impressed with the flavors served up at Two Ten Jack, we both felt that the price point was just a tad too high. That kept this rating from reaching that fifth star.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The garlic knots are for those who love garlic (aka, my people) and as I ate each garlicky piece, I hoped the garlic would work some magic in my gut and body, helping to clear all the lard from my arteries. At the very least, I knew it would smell out of my pores later and I felt bad for my future airplane seatmate. Didn't stop me from grabbing every piece of garlic off the plate! The salad is quite large and a meal in itself so I was glad we split that. I was quite full already after the half salad and one knot but I powered through and ate one more knot and all pizza because I'm not a quitter and make somewhat questionable eating choices. There was plenty of toppings on the different pizza slices so you could get some goodness in every bite. I appreciated that nothing was skimped on! Our water cups never ran empty, which was much appreciated because I needed the hydration to battle the humidity. We left extremely full and it was all less than $20 before tip. Not a bad deal!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's just one of those places that is always busy and popular and without question live up to the hype.Coming from Texas and living in Austin, it has similarities to setup and style to Home Slice Pizza.  From the one dining area to the take out area to the side and to the way the pizza is cooked and prepared.  Love them both so I can't really choose a winner as if I was given both, I would gladly eat them simultaneously.Order before to save some time and get a pizza and go grab a drink elsewhere while you wait and come back.  Or join the hype and nosh on some 'za.  It's simple ny-style pizza that doesn't need fancy toppings but they have those if you want them.  It's just good.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Also, why would I want pizza in the land of Nashville hot chicken? BUT TRUST ME, YOU DO. We ended up here for an afternoon snack & ordered to-go. I ordered garlic knots (Hand-cut NY style dough tied in knots, tossed in olive oil, fresh garlic and parmesan, served with a side of marinara) and had a bite of the Farmers' Market as well as the (vodka cream sauce based) and a proscuitto+basil pizzas.The garlic knots were freshly warmed and slathered in garlicky butter goodness. I loved that it was a dense garlic knot with a crusty outside and soft inside. As a testament to its delicious density, I was full after having 1.5 garlic knots. The piping hot marinara sauce was tasty too.The pizzas were fantastic. Flavors were harmonious especially on the Farmer's Market pizza. That vodka sauce is incredible. Vodka sauce is also part of a staple (Vodka Sauce Pie) pizza so if the specific special isn't available on the day you go, try that one instead! And of course, per usual NY style pizza, the crust is thin, crispy, but not burnt!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We opted out of the dining area and went next door. Such a cute and less crowded part of the establishment. We got our ginormous slices in record time at an excellent price. Definitely recommend to people who are visiting Nashville on a budget. I got the pepperoni and hubs got the Meat special of the day. Both were yummo. Cute, friendly neighborhood.

    "comments": "I was doubtful about any pizza place (after having worked in an authentic Italian pizza restaurant), but I ended up going for dinner on Friday night, following the recommendation of a local friend. Pizza is actually good and they have a couple of good beers too. There are not a lot of options for the pizzas, but the crust is crispy and thin. I tried Prosciutto and the special Cinco de Pie-o (very tasty, like a taco in a pizza (slightly greasy though)). On a Friday night it's usually packed and there's a line if you want a table and also if you want a full pizza. However you can order by the slice, which is way faster (and also a little bit expensive). Employees are nice. The place is close by a nice bar/concert venue called The Basement East (4 mins walk), to have more beers while listening to live music. It's a good plan.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We went to the bar to sit and have a drink while we wait.  The bartender was as friendly as could be. There was a great tap list with 16 craft, mostly local beers (see picture). The kids were hungry so we ordered single slices for them at the bar and they offered to have them pre-cut into small pieces. We were sat shortly and had some great pie! The pepperoni and basil was amazing and the best pizza I've had in Nashville. Most of the pizza's were around $14 for the 8 slice, perfect for 3 people. I highly recommend this place for a good slice or a whole pie.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Garlic infused olive oil drizzled over pizza dough baked to perfection and sprinkled with parmesan. I had one piece of pepperoni pizza and my wife had the meatball Stromboli. Absolutely nothing to complain about except for the parking situation. It was a Friday night, so, it is to be expected. The wait staff was on point as well. They kept the place moving so the wait for a table was much less than we expected. Carter was a great server!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Perfect for those late bar hopping nights in East Nashville. The slices are large enough to satisfy those late night munchies or just to soak up the alcohol. Will cost you about $3-$5 per slice. My personal favorite is the Prosciutto and Basil. So good! The  guys who work behind the counter also have some of the manliest beards I've seen this side of East Nashville. Definitely check them out if you're looking for some late night pizza/snack!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "On our journey of eating our way through Nashville continued, we decided that to eat at Five Points. This place has really good pizza. It's probably the best tasting pizza I've had in a while. No wait for a party of 3 since it was a Monday evening, but I've heard there can be a bit of a wait. There's some places close by to grab a drink or two if you need to pass some time.We ordered the garlic knots to start off our carbolicious meal. 100% delicious. I like big chucks of garlic smothering my knots, so this was totally my thing. They're big enough, so you only really need one knot to get you ready for your slice or pie. You can either order by the slice or pie, and you can also split your pie and get two different flavors. It was a tough decision, but we narrowed it down to the Meatball Pie and the Vodka Sauce Pie. All the flavors were amazing. I wanted my meatball slice to marry the vodka sauce slice and be together forever. I kind of want to relive this whole pizza experience all over again. For NY style pizza, this place is pretty great!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I get their meatball and pepperoni slices when we come in. Pretty good size - reminds you of a New York pizza slice (with paper plate, too).Loves:Great value - $10 or less lunch specials! I get their meatball and pepperoni slices when we come in. Pretty good size - reminds you of a New York pizza slice (with paper plate, too).Variety: Garlic knots, meatball, pepperoni, vegetarian pizza choices. It has something for any/every one. Vibe - I rarely talk about vibe, but this place just feels trendy when you walk in. Great music, classic walls, and the staff dressed without any uniforms.Location - right in the heart of 5 points so it's easy to move along any of the great places in this area if 1 is overcrowded.... that's how I found this place and Tenn Sixteen.Cons:Parking - as with anywhere in East Nashville, parking is become more rare daily.Seating - if you have more than 6 people, it can definitely be tough to sit together as there are limited tables, plus they are busy.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Having a ramen house in Nashville initially got me very excited so of course I had to try it out. Unfortunately the thick cloud of hipster stink spoiled everything around a good bowl of ramen. The fact they stress authenticity is the main problem I had with the place. I could accept takoyaki being fried like hush puppies instead of cooked in a cast iron mold and missing the appropriate sauces, but only if they presented it on an American twist. The word \"authentic\" was thrown around by staff all night which definitely help build up to disappointment. The overall effect ends up feeling like a hipster driven Cracker Barrel-esque attempt at authenticity rather than a labor of love. Fortunately the staff was very nice and helpful even if misguided. The over explaining of things I can understand based on being in Tennessee and the number of people there who just wanted to be seen.Echoing what others have said, the price is a bit much for the portions. And it's very odd to be suggested multiple courses before a bowl of ramen until you see the ramen is actually a cereal bowl size rather than the large typical punch bowl.I'll probably be back but just for the ramen. Unfortunately there's nothing close to it in Nashville which I'm sure is the whole reason this place opened in the first place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I love, love, love Two Ten Jack. I think it's a great restaurant and I am so excited that it is here in Nashville. I've been to Two Ten Jack two times now. The first visit was the first weekend that they were using their own menu and the second visit was this week.  When we visited the first time the waitress explained that the idea of the restaurant was to be a neighborhood pub where locals come for a drink and end up just staying to continue eating and drinking. We were obviously eager to try this method out and asked how the menu worked if we wanted to do the \"authentic\" meal. Basically you start with beer and an appetizer. Then you move to sake and sushi or a salad, followed by cocktails and skewers of meat, and finished with the ramen. It took us a couple of hours to do get through all of this but we had a blast. I suppose that you could go to any bar in Nashville and stay all night throwing back beers and eating bar food but what sets Two Ten Jack apart is the food is actually really good. I'm a big Japanese pickle fan so you know that I ordered those. They were excellent, not at all like the kind you get in sushi restaurant that I just assume come from a jar. These were just better: crunchy, fresh, and unique. We've had a bunch of the small plates (poke, shishito peppers, pork gyoza, JFC, short ribs, potato fries, and takoyaki). They are all very good. My husband liked the peppers but we both really enjoyed the JFC and short ribs. We've had all of the specialty sashimi. Our favorite by far is the miso-cured saba, which is mackerel. Omgawd, y'all it is like butter. I've never had mackerel like that before. The other options are unique. The pastrami has a mustard seed crunch to it. The tataki is very good but I didn't think the provided sake added much. The yellowtail is flavorful but the cilantro was overpowering. We've had a bunch of the sashimi and it was all fresh and tasty, definitely worth checking out if you are desperately searching for better sushi in Nashville. The only salad that I've had is the seaweed salad and it was really good. It was very different from the kind that is normally served in Nashville. I apologize but I don't remember the skewers that we've tried. They were good but obviously not as memorable for me as the sushi and small plates. What was definitely memorable was the ramen. We ordered bowls of the pork and I can't even begin to describe how good it was. The ramen was the reason we went back this week. They were out of the pork, so we ordered the chicken. It was good. The chicken was in a meatball, which I didn't care for. The broth had a very intense chicken flavor, which was very good but also spicy and not in a way that improved the flavor, in just a spicy way. I'm not a spicy fan, so this was a little disappointing. I still gobbled it up but I wouldn't order it again. In case you haven't picked up on this, eating here can be a lot of food. I would definitely suggest trying a lot and bringing people so that you can split the plates. You can't take the ramen home with you if you don't finish it. The first time we each got our own bowl. The last time my husband and I split a bowl and this was a lot better. If you are just eating ramen the one bowl per person is appropriate. I was surprisingly not hung over after our first visit. I was kind of worried about it after I realized that I had mixed all different kinds of booze. I could have been lucky so you might want to keep that in mind. Also, if you are doing to do the full menu + drinks, you're going to need a cab home.  **The only hitch at the moment is that they have not gotten a bunch of their Japanese liquors. The beer and sake section is particularly affected by this. In my world, that just means we have to come back when they get their supply issues resolve, which is certainly not a problem for us!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I initially did not want to go to Two Ten Jack for my birthday.  I'm generally averse to checking out a new place within its first month.  Man, am I ever glad that my wife talked me into it.  (I've only been proven wrong once, and that was with Josephine)You're really going to want to have a reservation.  Here's the catch: You have to have a part of 6 or more and they stop seating reservation parties after 6:30.  I have never felt more lucky to have a reservation in my life, because by the time that we were seated, there was a two hour wait.And I understand why.  Like a true Japanese izakaya, you're going to be sitting here and drinking and eating for a loooooong time.  And that is a great thing, trust me.  Our entire meal played out over the course of just under 3 hours, and the pacing was excellent for the most part.While were waiting for the rest of the party to arrive (and watching the bemused faces of the poor schmucks finding out how long they were going to have to wait), the hostess started talking up some of the cocktails.  They batch-make all of their cocktails, a program that is another fine creation of the team from PourTaste.  What that means in practice is that basically they have mass quantities of mixed drinks or punches if you will available on demand.  This speeds up booze service and makes life easy for both sides of the bar and is all the rage right now.   They also have a ton of beer, both draft and bottles, sake, shochu, and other booze I will probably judge you for ordering.We finally got our shit together and got seated and we were off.  Drink orders went in and the first course was a delicious moist towel. I opted for the Shochu pineapple/ginger tonic as my first bevvie (the New Belgium Yuzu I split with some friends didn't count as we weren't seated yet).  The server misunderstood me, because I said \"I'll take the first batch cocktail\" which he heard as \"I wanted the Number 1 cocktail\", which was actually number 3 on the menu.  It wasn't what I wanted, but was booze, and you're not going to see this guy complain.  I did get a chance to try the pineapple/ginger tonic, and it was exquisite, as was the Bourbon and Spice Beer (the second batch cocktail on the menu, but not to be confused with the No 2., which was actually number 4 on the menu.  Confused?)Next came the ordering of food.  Unfortunately, there have been some fucking morons who have written reviews bitching about portion sizes here.  Which is what I just hate about Yelp sometimes; everyone has an opinion, even the idiots who just don't know any better.  Guess what?  That's how this place is supposed to work.  Get a shitload of small plates, eat them over hours, share, and be merry.  And at the end, kill that bowl of ramen to sate any last hunger doubts you may have and waddle away with a sloshy belly.  And that is why the small plates are $6-8 mainly.  The Yakitori is $4-6 for the most part.  It's enough to taste and share - not enough to fill you up (that's what the ramen is for, assholes!).For the first round, we a ton of small plates.  Yeah, so the Takoyaki and Brussells sprouts got left behind.  That's ok.  Here's the deal.  The tofu is great, but you're going to have to distract your fellow patrons if you want to stand a chance to eat from the plate and get every morsel off.  The dumplings were freaking perfect.  And I would recommend getting a couple of orders, because ours didn't last long.  The Wagyu beef is tender, delicious and may be still mooing if you listen carefully.  And the fries.  I didn't order the fries.  I didn't ask for them.  But I'll be damned if they aren't delicious.  They are like deep-fried mashed potato spears served with an amazing sauce.  You're damn right we ordered more.  (and some more dumplings)Next up I got some sushi rolls, and while some didn't arrive, I was a bit too tipsy to care at the time.  And frankly, I was already thinking about the yakitori too much.The yakitori?  Everything was perfect.  It was exactly what my body needed at this point in the evening.  It's like the restaurant knew.  Everything tasted so good.  We finally got our Takoyaki, which was freaking amazing, especially with the butter, and the Brussells sprouts, which frankly I think are WAY overdone, but these guys piqued my interest on this cabbage cousin for the first time in YEARS.Which left us to ramen.  For those that bitch about Otaku South's pricing, guess what, it's more expensive at the $12-14 range.  And also, stop bitching.  What can I say, I got the pork bowl, it was full of lovely things, and made my night complete.  What else is there?  The vegetarians loved theirs too.  This place is simply amazing but  get a reservation or you'll be standing outside in your lady jeans, scarf, ironic oversized glasses, stupid hat that only Pharrell can pull off, and smoking American Spirits looking all mopey.  Oh wait, you're already good at that.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Amazing experience! This is a wonderful addition to not only East Nashville but the city in general. The menu has just the right selection so everyone is satisfied. Ramen, skewers, appetizers, and salads. There are even a few sushi rolls if you're not feeling like noodles. My friend and I sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of our group to arrive and had a couple of cocktails: ginger/pineapple tonic and Dutch on the Run. The tonic was as good as you'd expect, but Dutch was spectacular. The bartenders were very knowledgable and also gave us and other people at the bar samples! I'm okay with that.Most of us ordered the ramen bowls, which will definitely fill up anyone. My friend ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts, and let me just say: our drinks were great, so was dinner, even the dessert we sampled, but the BRUSSELS SPROUTS, GET OUT OF TOWN. They were that good.I will definitely be coming back here. The space is so cozy and the Japanese tavern style is unique for Nashville. It's been a while where I've been so wowed over a new restaurant.Disclaimer: they have a policy that does not allow you to take leftover ramen home.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I LOVE ramen. It is good expensive ramen. The awesome thing about ramen in Tokyo is that it is cheap and filling, even from famous ramen chefs are no more than $10 a bowl for much bigger portions. Normal ramen places do not suggest you to eat a 4 course meals but they focus on doing one thing really really well. For the ramen itself, I had the pork broth and it was good but wanted more broth with a bit more kick. And it wasn't very hot which I did not like. Noodles were good. Pork good. I just wanted a bigger portion. I am happy it opened and it does well, but it's expensive and not a place I'd go to except on special occasions or if I'm just really really desperate for ramen.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We did get here around 7:30 on a Friday for a group of 4. We're pretty patient people and prepared to wait. By that, I mean we went across the street and had drinks until our table was ready. I like that they call you when the table is ready. We still had drinks and asked if 5 more minutes was acceptable, and they were totally fine with it. I mean, they're already starting off awesome simply by being cool. We started off with beer, I had the Yazoo pale ale. Typical choice. My boyfriend had something I can't pronounce. Delicious choice. We started off with garlic knots. I don't even know how to describe the level of yum! I mean, there's dough... Amd it's covered in garlic, fresh basil, Annnnd of guess olive oil. I didn't even need the marinara offered. Pizza... I have a deep love for fresh mozzarella and most places don't do it, but FIVE POINTS DOES! I was extremely stoked about it! The crust, perfect.

My eyes were hungrier than my stomach which led us to order the 18 inch pizza and it was so much bigger than I thought it would be, could probably feed 6 people depending on how hungry everyone is.  The Bianca half was a little bland because it's only cheese and olive oil. I spiced it up with some red pepper flakes.  I should have ordered something with a little more density! The pepperoni had a hefty portion of pepperoni slices but it was a little on the greasy side.  Aside from my bad order, the pizza slice portions were enormous and worth the price.I would definitely come back here and maybe dine in for an appetizer and a beer!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Five Points delivers on it and executes perfectly. There's not much else to say.The carry-out side precisely shows that they \"get it\" and want to deliver the most authentic experience possible.

(I'm going to take a guess and say too much soy sauce)Chicken heart skewer was miniscule but tasty.Same with skirt steak skewer..  Good taste, miniscule portion.Volcano roll was good.House wine was Pinot Grigio at $7/glass.Friends ordered the vegetable broth ramen noodles with fried tofu and both of them picked out the tofu and left on a dish.One friend ordered the rum drink and said it was too strong and left most of it.Another friend ordered the ice cream coated with something..  mez a mez.When they get it together and have worked out the kinks and get some GF noodles, we will return to try once again.Guy sitting next to us ordered the pepper \"small\" plate and said the peppers needed spicing..So there were a lot of hit and misses, but it's a new restaurant, packed to the gills with people; had to ask barmaid for my change....Perhaps the owner is reading reviews and will make some much needed improvements so that return clients will be plentiful.** Parking is a challenge, since you have 7 restaurants fighting for parking spaces.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They were tender and full of flavor. We also had the octopus salad, which was served raw and on a bed of different veggies. It was so good. We had two sushi rolls - which are actually half sized rolls. The seafood is fresh, well seasoned, presented beautifully. The worst part was the service. We had a jumpy waiter who kept doing yoga-like poses in front of our table. He forget to put in the noodle bowls, split water, and didn't even know what kind of beer they had or anything about the types of sake. He seemed misinformed. Additionally he had his cell phone near our table and was very inattentive.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'm always very excited when a new restaurant opens up in my neighborhood. In the 4+ years I've lived in East Nashville I've seen culinary gems pop out of the woodwork to become local institutions. Two Ten Jack, serving Japanese comfort food, is the most recent food venture in the Walden Complex (Next to Silly Goose and Jeni's Ice Cream) and I'm sure it will become a neighborhood staple in no time, if it hasn't become one already.The interior feels warm and cozy while giving off a modern loft vibe. There's lots of polished concrete and wood. The layout of the restaurant takes great advantage of the space, placing the large bar at the center with different seating options around it (tables for four, booths for 6 and communal tables for whoever). The soft lighting was an excellent touch. I'm pretty happy that I have no snarky comments on decor this week- I was afraid I was getting into a rut.I have to mention how great the service was. From the second we walked in the hostess was friendly and super helpful. Our waitress was prompt and funny without being overbearing. All our food came out perfectly coursed, in the right order, promptly. For a young restaurant I was very impressed with the lack of service snags.Two Ten Jack is one of newest places to offer cocktails on tap. I went with the sochu ginger and pineapple tonic. The drink was light and refreshing and had a nice balance between the ginger and the sweet pineapple. Steve ordered the bourbon and spice beer drink and really loved it. I found his drink too bitter for my palate. I definitely ordered the \"girly\" drink and Steve went in a more \"manly\" direction.Since Two Ten Jack is an Izakaya joint they serve lots of small dishes to share, very similar to what you would see at a Tapas restaurant. For a snack with our cocktail we ordered the tsukemono (pickle plate). The menu said the pickles were made daily and fresh and it sure did taste that way. I loved the presentation that played up the bands of beautiful colors. I think there was burdock, jicama, beets and pepper, although I wasn't quite sure. The flavor was delicate and was a great addition to our cocktails.Our second dish was takoyaki which I haven't had since I left New York. Think of this dish as salty hush puppies with octopus. Don't let that be a deterrent- it gives the dough a light sea flavor. The takoyaki was hot out of the pan and very light. The bonito flakes added a nice burst of flavor and I LOVED the miso butter. Dipping the takoyaki in the miso butter intensified all of the flavors. THAT BUTTER WAS SO GOOD. I'm not ashamed to say that I finished what was left of the butter after all the takoyaki was gone. This is a must-order dish.Our next dish was a choice from the small sushi and sashimi menu. The sushi here is more expensive than what you find at other places around town. We chose the volcano roll which had scallops, spicy mayo and we added snow crab, which was a special that evening. The roll was nicely balanced and I loved the delicate preparation of the scallops. The sushi rice had a smaller grain than what I am used to but overall the roll was nice, although I'm not sure worth $13.We then moved on to yakitori and ordered skewers of short rib and chicken hearts. The short rib was cooked well with a lot of pink on the inside. Medium rare always brings out the flavor. ALWAYS. The chicken hearts were surprisingly chewy. I can't remember if I ever had whole chicken hearts before so I can't compare. What I can say is that it had a great salty, spicy and sweet seasoning which won me over, allowing the texture to grow on me.For our final dish we ordered the tonkotsu ramen. This dish is a pork lover's dream, with a rich pork broth and pieces of pork belly. The soy and toasted garlic flavor were present and just added to the pork fat goodness. The egg was a joy, the lightly cooked yolk just coating your tongue. The noodles were nice and al dente and didn't lose their texture in the hot soup. This dish made me so happy. I'm pretty sure I'll go back here and order a bowl of ramen just for me. NO SHARING.For dessert we did the chef sampling of ice cream Mochi. While the server told us that these are not made in house, she did say they were made for the restaurant from a small distributor. I appreciate their honesty. We had the mango, azuki bean and cinnamon flavors. I always love the mild sweetness of azuki but I was blown away by the cinnamon one. I have to say that cinnamon ice cream might be my new favorite thing.I really liked my experience at Two Ten Jack. The food was great, the atmosphere was comfortable and the staff was friendly and well trained. Welcome to the neighborhood. I'm happy you're here!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "There is a 100% chance that I would choose ramen for my last supper.  Whenever my boyfriend and I travel, we go out of way to get ramen...we once took two $60 cab rides into NYC to get Momofuku ramen during a layover.  Ramen is our passion we were very pleased with our experience at Two Ten Jack this past Friday.  We tried to go a few weeks ago but were horrified with the 90 minute wait so this time around, we went at 10:00 PM and sure enough we were able to walk right in.To start, we shared the pork belly and chicken heart skewers.  The pork belly had the perfect ratio of meat to fat and the kitchen cooked it perfectly; seared with a crust on the outside but still juicy and moist on the inside.  It was absolutely delicious!  The chicken hearts were also cooked very well but the flavor was just a little bit boring.  It didn't taste bad by any means but the hearts definitely could have been bolder.I got the chicken ramen and my boyfriend got the tonkatsu ramen.  Both were outstanding!  We were really impressed with the body and flavor of both broths and serving each broth with its own noodles was a really great touch.  The portions were a bit on the small side but that only means that there weren't leftovers to bring home...which is probably a good thing because leftover ramen doesn't taste too great.In all, Two Ten Jack is a pretty good ramen house and an establishment that we will definitely go to again.  This isn't a 5 start review because the servers can be a bit aloof.  The servers left 2 unused plates and napkins on our table for the entirety of our meal.  The weird part was that we were sitting at a small table for 2 but there were 4 plates and napkins on the table originally...why are there twice as many plates as the maximum number of people that can be seated at the table?\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Entering the restaurant i could tell this was a very hipster trendy place and being from LA i felt at home so GREAT start. We started with an order of gyoza and ordered our ramen right away; tonkotsu. First the gyoza oh man, cooked perfectly, nice and golden crispy on one side; and the inside fillings delicious!! oh and the ponzu sauce not sure if they added anything to theirs but it tasted way better than most. Now the main event if you don't know \"I AM A RAMEN SNOB\" been to all the best spots or claim to be the best spots from Japan, NY to LA and let me tell you two ten jack holds up with some of the best. The egg was perfect, great texture, runny yolk good flavor; the broth very hardy and flavorful, bold flavors not the best tonkotsu broth but really good. Now the noodles oh man one slurp into my mouth and i got a flash back like i was in japan slurping away so very very good noodles and last the chasu... not so good, good texture a little crispy but the taste not so great, almost like they added sugar or something very sweat taste didn't pare with the ramen. Overall this place is good, if they put one in LA it would do really well, top 5 id say, so IM A FAN and when i do come back to Nashville i will def be back to try some more ramen keep up the great work.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

But when the wait for Silly Goose was 20 minutes, we wandered over here. I'm so glad we did!Just like every place in East Nashville, it was packed, so we took one of the last seats at the very well designed bar. We started off with spicy edamame, which wasn't spicy to me and very tasty. Then we shared several different small plates and all were wonderful! We had bacon wrapped asparagus, a little salad that I can't remember the name of, several skewers including chicken wings and scallops, and a bowl of garlic noodles. I highly suggest trying a bunch of different things like we did and splitting them. I didn't notice the usual crazed confusion that comes with brand new restaurants, so kudos to the team here for being so ready for opening.Our bartender/server, Buddy, was really awesome. He made a mocktail for my pregnant self and must have spent five minutes making it. It had coconut milk, pineapple juice, mint, and I think some other stuff in it. It was the best fake drink I've ever had! My husband got a martini that had a curry taste to it and he really enjoyed it. They seem to have a good selection of rare and intriguing liquors and an extensive and unique cocktail list. I was truly impressed with this place and looking forward to going back soon!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Stop by.We sat at the bar so we would not have a long wait....on a Wednesday night. Had the spicy edemame. My wide had a mocktail created by the bar tender of pineapple, coconut milk and mint that she enjoyed. I ended up having a drink that had curry, basil, gin and star anise. Very tasty.We order the scallop, bacon & asparagus, shitaki and chicken yazaki. All were wonderful and look forward to trying more. We also got the garlic noodles which were very tasty. One think I look forward to going back and trying is a ramen bowl. A gentleman next to me got one and I was jealous. Looked delicious.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We went in last Friday night after trying to get in the previous week but being told there was 2 hour (!!) wait. Our party of four got in around 6pm and ended up sitting at a family-style table in the back with two other parties. We weren't told that's how we'd be seated, but it worked!The hubs and I shared the edamame to start. It was salted really perfectly and tasted awesome. I had the bourbon and spice beer and it was SO good. I absolutely loved it and would order it again. He had the death of meiji and said it was one of the better drinks he's had.We shared some sushi (gojira and always sunny). I liked the always sunny much better than the gojira. I felt the gojira pieces didn't stick together well and it was really difficult to eat. I want to try the Nashville though. It sounds kind of awful, but I'm sure it's good.We split the chicken ramen. Honestly, I wasn't super impressed. The broth was okay but very mildly flavored. For the price, I expected a bit more punch.All in all, we spent $70 between the two of us and I'd say it was fair. Our server was AWESOME and gave us lots of insight into the menu. She was also really laidback and didn't speed along our dinner, which I liked.It's safe to say we'd go again, but maybe not for awhile.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Everything I've ever had has exceeded expectations. Drinks are fantastic as well, and a surprisingly large selection of Asian beers. Mixing and matching with appetizers is a good way to go. Don't overlook the raman though. For the price it's the best thing on the menu. If they served it as take out I'd have it for dinner at home once a week (and likely die from sodium intake).\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Oh boy, this place is delicious. I'm excited to have a place like this in Nashville.My first impression- the styling of the restaurant is impressive. As someone who loves traditional Japanese design, I looooved it. Oh boy, the food was good. We had the vegetarian ramen, shishito peppers, potato fries, and the eggplant/corn yakitori. Our least favorite was the yakitori & I probably would not order it again. Maybe the meat yakitori is better. That ramen was so delicious it haunts my dreams. My favorite small plate was the shishito peppers. The only thing I would change is that our server was not very knowledgable. She originally told us that the brussel sprouts, aged tofu, and hush puppy dish was vegetarian. After we ordered, she came back multiple times because they weren't vegetarian & we had to order something else. It was a bummer because I got sooo excited about our order! When I ordered the yakitori she told me it probably wasn't vegetarian because it had miso on it. Miso is vegetarian! Miso soup is not. I would have loved a more informed waitress or at least designation on the menu about what dishes are vegetarian. For clarification, the ONLY small dishes that are vegetarian are the shishito peppers & potato fries. I believe something was left off of at least one of them to make them vegetarian, so make sure you speak up to your server if that concerns you. I'll be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Meh. I hate to be that yelper who posts a less than stellar review on a high rated place but I wouldn't be a good yelper if I wasn't honest. First impression was it looked very nice. We sat in the outdoor patio because we had our pup with us (they're dog friendly) and we were greeted by our waitress right away with water and an explanation of the menu. She was very helpful with recommendations and translating anything on the menu. Their menu is small and not super descriptive of the items. What I mean is very vague. I ordered the sunomono which typically is octopus or conch served with some cucumber and rice vinegar. What actually came out was a small plate with shredded lettuce and just a few small pieces of octopus and scallop. $9 for that. Next I ordered a miso soup which was good but too salty and that's a lot coming from me because I'm the kind of person who likes salty stuff and it was $5 for this little cup of it. Lastly I ordered the volcano roll just to give it one more shot. Ugh. $15 for 4 pieces of ordinary \"sushi\" that lacked so much flavor. My fiancé ordered the pork ramen and even he said it was way too salty but he ate it anyway because he was hungry. We really were not impressed and came out to be quite disappointed despite the great reviews. The two stars are just for the staff because they provided good service but the quality of food and the price did not match and was a super turn off for us.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We tried going once before and the wait was 1hr and a half- for some bloody noodles. Tonight, it was 40 minutes, but they had immediate seating at the bar so we stayed. The bartender was perfect. She offered recommendations and was attentive but not overbearing.  The drinks she prepared looked great- bf LOOOOVVVVEEED them. The ramen was quite tasty and surprisingly filling and the appetizer was delicious as well. I wish I could describe the food better, but for some reason, I'm coming up short. I can say the ramen was very flavorful. The ambiance was nice. I like the way they decorated and designed it. It definitely had a Japanese feel to it.

I felt that it had too much mayo in the spicy sauce, but the bf loved it. lastly we got the chicken ramen and it was flavorful and spicy. wish there were more chicken meatballs, but the broth was so tasty. the bar and restaurant decor is simple and sexy. service was great as we sat at the bar. can't wait to come back!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We had a large party, 10 plus, but Two Ten Jack was responsive when I reached out about their private room. They were accommodating and even let us add one more at the last minute. Everything was perfect once we got there. We got drinks at the bar while we waited for our entire party to arrive. Our waiter was attentive especially for a large party, nobody had to wait for a drink refill. And he accurately split our checks five ways. Seriously that's a feat.

And a big thanks to the servers who took care of us! We kept moving around, so I know we weren't easy to keep track of!First, I have to say, Two Ten Jack answers my prayers. Japanese food AND craft beer? Yes please!!! We all tried some appetizers to start. I tasted the edemame and the poke. The edemame was covered in a sweet chili sauce. I'm still not sure how I feel about that, but it was pretty good. However, not something I loved enough to want to try replicating at home. The poke on the other hand was amazing! I would definitely recommend this small plate. The tuna was very flavorful and it came with sesame chicharron - very interesting pairing.For my main dish, I tried the yasai shoyu (vegetable ramen). Again, my prayers are answered. I haven't had a good bowl of ramen since I was actually in Japan, but this fit the bill. The broth was very flavorful, and had a lot of depth for a vegetable broth. The noodles were a perfect al dente. The veggies in the ramen were also perfectly done. It came with a burnt corn that was to die for. I don't know where they found such a sweet corn this time of year, but keep it coming! They topped the ramen bowl with slices of pickled ginger, which gave the overall flavor a wonderful snap.The only downside was I felt everything was a tad on the pricy side for relatively small plates. However, the ramen was fairly priced and you got a big bowl of it. I definitely did not walk away hungry!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Every employee there was friendly. The host thought we were a table of 3 instead of 2 so he sat someone in front of us. Still only a few extra minute wait and not a big deal, at all, he felt so bad though, he gave us a full order of garlic knots on the house. That's someone that cares about their customers. Oh, and those garlic knots....HUGE.The knots were massive, had actual garlic on them and mouth watering just thinking about them. The best garlic knots I have ever had. They had to have been handmade and rolled. I seriously was tempted to order some garlic knots to go and eat at my hotel later that evening. We also order a 14 inch pizza half of which was the Pesto Pie and the other half was the Supreme. The slices were also huge with fresh ingredients and the perfect New York style thinness. We ended up taking 4 slices back to the hotel because we ate all of the full size of garlic knots (no regrets). However, the leftovers did not make it back to the hotel because we ate the rest of the pizza 3 hours later in the car. Even cold, the pizza was magical. This place was perfect. Everything about it was on point. The service, the food, the location, the beer selection. It was the perfect combination for a pizza joint. I make it a point to try local pizza in every city I go to, this was easily one of the better pizza places I have experienced.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I moved from NJ to Nashville only a few months ago and it's been VERY difficult finding a decent pizza place. Five Points is the best pizza I've had in Nashville by far! It's Brooklyn-style so it's big and great to fold and eat. The cheese pizza was good, and the pepperoni was great! I ordered some garlic knots and not only were they HUGE they were excellent, some of the best I've ever had. Had a cannoli for dessert and it was also great (though a little small)They have a good beer selection, and even serve wine as well. The dining side is fairly small, which means the staff is very attentive and your food comes out fairly quickly. They serve other Italian food (salads, pasta, etc) too so there's variety, buy the pizza is the way to go!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Came here for lunch on a Thursday and were seated immediately at the table of our choice. The service was great! Our server was nice, attentive, & knowledgeable about the menu. I got the prosciutto-basil slice with arugula salad and a basil lemonade. Everything was delicious! In fact, I have regrets about not ordering a whole pie to-go because I started craving it the moment we left. But the good news is that I no longer have to go to New York to get a real New York style pizza. I can just come to Music City.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Best pizza in Nashville! Slightly overpriced- yes. Do I care? No. The crust is consistently perfect - crisp and thin with a nice chew. I'm a big fan of the vodka pizza but you can't go wrong with a classic either. The garlic knots are pretty fantastic too. We usually do take out and the wait is around 20-30 minutes. What's great about this place is they are open pretty late serving slices so you can always stumble in from a nearby bar. Sometimes they even do free slice nights!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were searching for a quick bite to eat before heading out for the night, and found this gem!  The server recommended the lemonade!  It was fantastic!  Get it!!!!! So we ordered a round and some garlic knots while we looked over the pizza options!  If I lived in Nashville, I'd be the fattest person alive, because all I would eat is lemonade and garlic knots!!!! It's best for my health that I don't live near this place!!! We ordered a combo pizza and a white sauce pizza, they were both good! The combo was better then the white sauce pizza(but honestly, I'm not a fan of white sauce pizza, so do not take my opinion!  Everyone else liked it! If you like white sauce pizza, order it!)   We left full and had pizza to enjoy at home later!  I would come back here in a heart beat!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ate the Bianca first and I must have been too I'll for the T-Rex but it just felt a little too meaty. Still good but like I said I was too full to probably enjoy it. The garlic knots were good bit I don't really see all the hype in it. The line was an hour wait but you can walk around and they will call your cell when table is ready.

    "comments": "As a tourist from NYC and a bona fide pizza snoot, I scoffed at the prospect of finding a decent pizzeria outside the Big Apple. But when our Tennessee host and both of our Uber drivers included Five Points Pizza in their lists of top must-visit eateries, my husband and I resignedly gave it a try. If you get there past 11 pm as we did, know that they only take orders through the window (think pedestrian drive through), but our slices were shoved into a screaming hot oven and ready on dual paper plates in minutes. Because I'm a purist, I ordered the cheese pizza, which was respectably thin and well toasted throughout, providing the perfectly rigidity with which I could execute the traditional New Yorker fold and hold. If I had any complaints, it would be that the layer of cheese was just a tad too thick (the smattering of Parmesan cheese notwithstanding), enveloping that beautiful crust with an adipose blanket of mozzarella that ended up smearing oil over my mouth with every bite. Then again, most people would hardly consider that a minus. Take it from the converted New Yorker - Five Points knows how to do a slice right. If you're looking for pizza, this should be your first and only stop.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE:1.  It's 50/50. First time my roomie brought it home on a Friday night (30+ min. drive home BTW) and it was INCREDIBLE. I was OBSESSED and had to go back the NEXT WEEKEND MYSELF.  However, I went on a Saturday laaaaate afternoon to take home for dinner with the hubs, NOT NEAR AS GOOD. WHYYYYYY. WHY IS THIS PLACE HIT OR MISS???!2.  YOU NEED TO KNOW that you'll likely pay for parking just to walk across the street to pick up your pie. Add $5 (minimum) to the cost of the pizza, b/c that's going to be pretty standard.The traffic flow is super obnoxious so be prepared and plan accordingly.3.  YOU DEF NEED TO KNOW their garlic knots are RIDICULOUSLY AH-MAZING. There are literal chunks of garlic on them. MY DREAM, to die in a bathtub full of them while being the perfect amount of full in a gluten comma drifting away dreaming about them. Pretty great, right?4.  Pepperoni, it's good. I'm pretty picky about pizza meat. It's yummy here. 5.  Overall make sure you drink water... all the salt is enough to have you begging for cold fresh water, overnight and through the next day, especially when you eat the leftovers.6.  Leftovers. The pizza is amazing leftover, the garlic knots, not near as good as the pizza... you know what that means?  Eat all the garlic knots and you can finish off the pizza the NEXT DAY.7.  YOU DEF NEED TO KNOW if you go on a Saturday and go in for pick up etc. It's slamming busy, probably all the seats are taken, and you'll likely have a long wait in line just to pick up and pay for your to-go pizza.  Insanity.Overall, I'm not SOLD on this place. I'm a girl that likes consistency ya'know?Please me every time I eat your food, and I'm forever yours.Jury is still out on Five Points Pizza.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I honestly don't know what kind of black magic they use to pack so much flavor into the veggie ramen, but I hear it's even better than the pork broth. The octopus hush puppies with miso seem a little odd at first bite, and then they grab you with their eight tiny tentacles and won't let go. Just kidding. I never really noticed the octopus. I also really enjoy the seaweed salad. The hours of operation are probably the worst thing about this restaurant.

I'd heard such good things about it from friends who raved about the tonkotsu pork broth ramen, and was faced with the dilemma of how not to look like a huge snooty a-hole if the ramen actually sucked. Luckily, I didn't have to worry, because the ramen was pretty spot on. The broth tasted really close to what you'd get in downtown Hakata. Same goes for the gyoza (though I think Two Ten Jack uses better pork than what you'll get at a $3 stall in Japan!). The yakitori was all right too - I recommend the pork belly, again definitely high quality pork being used. We will definitely be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Both were good, a bit over sauced and not the best sprouts I've ever had. Maybe a good way to introduce people who don't like them. Nigiri: we got the salmon belly. Tiny little slivers of good tasting fish, but for a fatty cut of fish, I like the serving to be a bit plumper!Yakitori: we got the avocado and skirt steak. Avo was a half of an avocado grilled with some ponzu in the cavity and a little wasabi to mix in. Would have been better during avocado season or in California or in avocado season in California. Skirt steak were good tasting morsels of steak on a skewer. Could have had a few with the nice little rub they came with.Finally the ramen. We got the pork, which was rich and earthy with thinner noodles (imported from Hawaii?) and a slab of pork in it. Very good, would have been a great 8 dollar bowl in japantown. Only we don't have a japantown here. Darn it. We will be a little more judicious with our ordering next time and it will be a bit better. If there is a next time.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "AMAZING FOOD! And the service was great, too. Loved that they handed us warm, wet cloths with citrusy scents to wash our hands before our meal. This is something I always do, and they saved me a trip to the ladies' room by doing this. The food was so yummy. That's an understatement actually. Ineffably delicious. I had the crispy brussels, and it was so hard to share with my husband who had to eat at a slower pace while he held our 11-month-old. The ramen was equally incredible. My husband had nothing but rave reviews despite our $78 check, and he's majorly frugal, so this was saying something. (He had sashimi, about which he is quite picky, and fell in love.) You can order many small plates if you'd like, which was nice. Hubby had a drink recommended by the waitress--it was 11 bucks but per him, worth every penny. Great atmosphere, classy joint aesthetically, and I can't stress just how yummy. My only complaints are that some of the prices are a little over the top, such as 9 bucks for the garlic noodles. Apparently they use crab butter on these, which probably jacks up the price, but they were for my picky 5-year-old, so I would have nixed the crab butter and hoped for spending maybe 5 bucks instead. Hubby's drink could have been maybe 2 bucks cheaper, too. Overall, though, the place exceeded our expectations...we weren't sure it would be suitable for a family with kids, with its \"hip\" reputation, and it was great. Very spacious seating. The staff was also quite knowledgeable about allergen content in the dishes and precautions to be taken (we called ahead as there is a peanut allergy in the family). You must eat here. Must.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We also tried green tea and rasberry mochi which were both good but i preferred the rasberry. I don't know what is with all the negative reviews on this place, I've only been here once but we will be back to try more.

    "comments": "Two Ten Jack!It's at the end of the row of businesses behind Jeni's. The very end. If you don't see it when you park, you must look much much harder. I, walked all the way around the back side of the building before I found it....Interior is comfortable until more people show up. I went on Wednesday around 5 and we were seated right away, no reservation. The place was bare bones until about 6:00 really. Waitress and staff are helpful and friendly.  Good place to chat. Good place to sit alone. Now on to the good part.The drink menu is large. If you like sake/beer/wine/alcohol, I think it will work for you.The food, we just ordered until we were full. No need to get your hopes up about the ramen unless you plan on saving room to eat it or just order it outright. We didn't, so I cant' comment on the ramen. I did have the miso soup (good, but not the best I've ever had), the J.F.C. (good, but you have to REALLY like the flavor, otherwise, I'll pass next time), the asparagus and bacon skewer (chewy, thick bacon, crunchy asparagus, just ok), and the garlic noodles.  I also had the sake punch happy hour special for $5. I'll say the drink was tasty, but didn't hit me until much later in the evening.  Garlic noodles were my favorite and surprisingly very light. I thought I would need a box, but I managed to finish the whole bowl without filling the slightest bit stuffed. My friend ordered several skewers, which were all good (chicken meatball, and several others) . All in all, satisfying experience. I'd go back, but I'll try different things next time. The menu is definitely large enough for that.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Only slight complaint I had was that the portions of everything but the ramen were really small and quite expensive.  My boyfriend paid $11 for what turned out to be a really tiny bowl of noodles.  But they were delicious so that makes up for it.  Overall I'd recommend this place for a classy fun night out.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "AmbianceLove love love the outdoor patio and the restaurant's overall ambiance and feel. It's much larger than I thought and the decor is very much in line with the upcycled natural material decor of so many cozy feeling restaurants nowadays. The servers dress like \"Rosie the Riveter\", which I thought was cute. Five stars here.ServiceStaff are really helpful and kind, including the owners. Tonight, on my second visit (I really really wanted to love everything about this place, so went back again), I overheard the lady next to me saying she was allergic to citrus. Citrus?! Yeah, crazy, and so unfortunate. But the server was extremely sweet and went to the kitchen to find out what on the menu she could enjoy. He came back with a list of food that she could order, and she kept asking, \"Well, what about this? Or this?\" And he kept saying patiently, \"Well, I asked about that, and chef said that it wouldn't be good without the marinade, which has citrus in it.\" Even the eggs in the ramen were marinated in citrus!Anyhow, I was very impressed with the time and energy the staff and owners spent on making sure this lady enjoyed her dining experience. Top notch.FoodThis is where I had to lower my rating, unfortunately. As for the food I actually ate, the first time I went my friend and I ordered the spicy miso edamame. While tasty, the miso sauce was a bit heavy. I know it's likely because of the miso texture, but maybe it could have been thinned a little with some rice wine vinegar. The edamame were cooked well, with a nice crunch to the bean, but tender shells from which to pull them. We then ordered some of their specialty sashimi, the miso cured saba (mackerel), which had an interesting texture (again, which I attribute to the miso), but was terribly fishy. This was disappointing. Well, we both really came here for the Ramen, so I tried the tonkatsu (pork), and my friend had the yasai shoyu (vegetable). The tonkatsu had a little too much black garlic oil and it overpowered a lot of the flavor. The pork was buttery, which I thought was pretty good, but may be a bit fatty for others. I was also surprised when I saw the noodles were more reminiscent of a buckwheat soba, but was pleasantly surprised about the texture of it with the rest of the bowl. I had a taste of the yasai shoyu and in contrast with mine, tasted light and delicious.So tonight my boyfriend and I tried the seaweed salad, which came out with a much thicker marinade that we're used to. And it was a bit overpowered with lime. I did like that there was a variety of seaweed in their version. Just lighten the sauce! I ordered the vegetable ramen, which was pretty good still. The noodles were nice and chewy and the flavor was not as overpowering as the tonkatsu. The crunch of the corn kernels were a nice addition. The boyfriend ordered the tori paitan, which was waaaaaaaaaay too salty, and as other reviewers have mentioned, a bit difficult to stomach. He ended up eating just the noodles and some bites of the chicken meatballs.I may go back here sometime and try some of their other small plates and yakitori because I do love the patio oh so much, especially in this weather!Happy Hour is from 4 to 6 pm on weekdays, offering 2 for 1 PBR tall boys (super classy), Asahi, and other bottled beer, as well as $5 glasses of house red and white wine.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

You're expectation of this place should be that it's a mediocre take on Japanese food that will fill you (for a pretty penny), and won't leave you satisfied. The menu will tell you the ramen is to be eaten hot and you won't even be offered any to go boxes so it should be devoured. Well if it was actually served hot, you might not taste the overpowering soy flavor of the 'soup' you're served. For these prices I'd expect something a little more authentic and much better prepared. Again, it's a cool looking place, and actually the drinks are pretty good (that's worth a star).

We got a drink at the bar while we waited. I don't have a single bad thing to say, except that I wish I had some of that pork ramen this morning too. It was that good. Be warned: this has nothing to do with the restaurant itself but the location does not have super great parking so either come early or be prepared to circle the block a few times. It's totally worth it though! For 2 cocktails, an appetizer, and 2 bowls of ramen plus tax and tip we spent about $65-70. You could easily get out for around $30 though if you just did ramen, and could also justify around $200 if you tried some of everything. Worth every penny, and the wait!

I ordered my drink some time before any food was ordered and received it after the second small plate hit the table. Also, I poured my own water the entire time. If you're at the table talking, go ahead and pour the water for the guest. All in all, it was a great experience and I will return.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Also they didn't offer whole pies but instead offer slices of 3 choices (cheese, pepperoni, and some other one... I forgot but it was a fancy expensive slice lol). It was a little pricey for a slice ($4-ish) but they were pretty big and very tasty. It was definitely comparable to a NY pizza slice as it is on thin crust, has simple ingredients, and oh so yummy.

After 6 1/2 yrs living in Nashville, it is time to go home to Charleston, WV...what started out as a 3yr contract lasted 6 1/2 yrs...and I fell in love with this pizza establishment. I remember the very first day we stumbled across the doorstep of this great pizzeria!!Tony and I was out exploring our new city and we found Five Points and fell in love with the neighborhood. Then we found the best restaurant in the city...and have been coming back about every 2 months. We live on the other side of town, so we have to fight traffic and travel about 20-25 minutes one way passing tons of restaurants to get here. We have stood in line down the sidewalk waiting for a table in the cold drizzling rain just to have some hot buttery Garlic Knots. I always order a slice each of the special pizza of the day. There is always a meat and a veggie...and I get one of each. Tonight for my farewell to Five Points Pizza dinner I had a cold soda, a slice of the Sausage, Jalapeno, Red Peppers and Vodka Sauce and a slice of the veggie with Artichoke, Spinach, Mushrooms, Garlic, Mozarrella and Feta with oil base no sauce pizza..both AWESOME...Noel went with her usual go to Pepperoni ( 2 slices) and a Abita Rootbeer of course !!! and Tony had a Pepperoni slice and 2 PBR's and we shared a large order of the Garlic Knots with Marinara sauce...I didn't want to leave!! I will truly miss this Pizza Place..hate to call it a pizza joint...but I am one of their biggest fans and if I am ever again in the area, MY FIRST STOP will be FIVE POINTS PIZZA....the best in Nashville !!!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Not expecting anything special to be open at midnight, we found Five Points and I can say that it blew my taste buds away.  With a dive bar atmosphere, they offer a large selection of specialty pies and local craft brews. Naturally, my group decided to start with a $7 beer flight of local beers based off the recommendation of the waiter (awesome brews) and some garlic knots. For the main course we decided to go with the meatball pie and Zeus and both were delicious. We ordered two 18\" pies for 5 of us and we had enough for leftovers. Everything was so good and I would defiantly recommend!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Talk about hitting the spot after having a few drinks at a nearby brewery! We got a slice each, which is all you need to have a savory pizza experience. Clearly the joint is popular, as the main restaurant was pack to the brim. We walked over next door and discovered a 'to-go' area where you can also buy by slice. This place brought back lots of delicious New York-pie style memories -- authentic and flavorful. Thank goodness we only stuck with a slice, not that I would have been ashamed to walk the streets of East Nashville donning a major food baby. So good. So tasty.

We started with garlic knots based on all the reviews and recommendations to order them and weren't disappointed at all! Super tasty with marinara and a side of bleu cheese to dip in. Next we ordered a large South Brooklyn and it was fantastic. I'm a huge carnivore and left 5 points without eating a single ounce of meat and was still very full and satisfied with my choices. Will definitely be back to sample other pizza options at the sit down area. I've been to the walk up window section plenty of times but thought I should expand and finally come in, sit down, and enjoy some good pizza and beer. Mmmm.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

All were absolutely delicious. My favorite was the vodka blush followed by the meatball pizza. I am not a spicy fan so I didn't try the habenero pizza, however, everyone else said it was great. They gave us fresh basil for the specialty pizzas and even sprinkled fresh basil on the garlic knots. Delicious!! The cooks were also very friendly. They noticed my brother trying to take a picture of one of the guys tossing the pizza so he warned him just before he did it. They also checked on us since we had been waiting for a while because they thought we ordered by the slice and it had gotten lost. We waited to order til we got there but it still didn't take long.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Five Points Pizza meets all the marks and deserves 5 stars, no question.It's New York style pizza with thinner crust and monstrously large slices, which is great. The crust is very tasty and good quality, just crispy enough without being overdone. The sauce and toppings are both very good quality as well, truly all around delicious. There is a sit down portion of the restaurant as well as a to-go area which has few seats if you just want to pop in for a slice. They sell cheese and pepperoni pizza by the slice every day as well as a rotating veggie meat pizza, so there are always good options. They also have a window open late night and a few beers on tap as well. I'm a big fan!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm from Michigan and I've had NY style pizza in NY countless times, so usually when I see a place claiming to make \"NY style pizza,\" I kind of give it a side eye and set my expectations low.This place totally blew me away. We ordered a salad and split it between the two of us (which was more than enough, btw), garlic knots, and a basic pepperoni pizza. The garlic knots were huge, smothered, and so, so, good. I think I ate more garlic knots than I did anything else, but I really love bread. The pizza was thin, the crust was perfect, and everything was so fresh. They have a ton of craft beers, if you're into that. Our waiter was on top of everything throughout our entire meal and luckily for us, we went kind of early and didn't have to wait for a table. I've heard the wait can be atrocious, so I'd either go early (around 5ish) or just get take out, which they have an entire separate entrance for.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The stromboli, the awesome beer list, and ohh the garlic knots... comfort was found in this food.I came back with friends and we enjoyed custom pizza plus garlic knots plus a shared spinach stromboli. The dough is tasty and fresh. The toppings are always fresh. Whether I come for an early dinner, dinner at the peak of busy, or a late night snack, the staff is always friendly and accommodating. Prices are reasonable, especially when sharing among a group.Tip: if the wait is long and your group is small, look for a seat at the bar to eat. Elevated above the rest of the restaurant, you get prime people watching and the bar tenders are friendly without being annoying. Plus the beers and food come fast since you're closer to the source.Parking can be a little tricky you you go looking in nearby lots, but by parallel parking on the street, I've never have to park more than a couple blocks away.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our service was very good - the waiter explained food/drink pairings and we had someone else come over at the end of the meal to ask about the overall experience. The food was good. Crispy brussel sprouts were excellent - lightly fried and in some type of broth that was delicious. Pork ramen was alright, but not as good as Otaku South. Our waiter made a point to tell us that the restaurant did not have to go boxes so make sure to not over order. My wife and I both ate all of our ramen, but I really despise the fact that we wouldn't be allowed to take the food we paid for out of the restaurant if we didn't finish.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Holy moly the ramen was to die for! I had chicken broth and my spouse had the pork. We enjoyed both. Our waitress told us the broth had been marinating for a crazy amount of hours which explains the incredible flavor. Staff was friendly and our waitress was A+.

    "comments": "Really enjoyed dinner, other then 1 rude hostess (the other one was great) and a couple of problems with price/portioning (as others have mentioned) this would definitely get 5 stars from me. Still don't know how a hostess can be unpleasant, its the first impression you get of a place, just hire a happy person.  I will mention that they don't seat you until your entire party is present which is always annoying when you have a reservation, but understandable. Drinks: The bartender was great despite being slammed with every seat taken by people not only drinking but eating. Super excited that they had 3 different Hitachino beers on draft (6 dollars a bottle at stores!), but somehow they were out of all 3 on opening weekend. Also tried the Shochu flight, haven't developed a taste for it yet but could see myself getting used to it. Death of Meiji (Willet pot still bourbon, Ume Kokuto sake, Benedictine, Rothman & Winter apricot, lemon, Angostura bitters), great drink, saw her put 2 shots of Willet in the shaker, that alone is worth 11 bucks not to mention everything else in it. Friend had the No.1 on tap: Broker's gin, Cynar, plum & peppercorn shrub, lemon cordial, Peychuad's bitters. She enjoyed it, and again it was a generous pour. Food: To start tried the JFC (Japanese Fried Chicken), and a couple of Yakitori (chicken hearts and sweet shrimp). The JFC was tasty, could have used a little heat and been crispier but would eat again. Chicken hearts were delicious (4 on a skewer) for 4 bucks which I think is reasonable. Wish they had livers/chicken skin, maybe in the future. The Sweet Shrimp is basically 1 shrimp (not a giant prawn or anything) skewered from tail to head with entire head intact, it was not only awesome looking but the best thing I ate all night..though it was 8 dollars...for 1 shrimp. They really need to change this, at least 3 servings or this dish is unsustainable. I understand its an Izakaya and you are ordering lots of small dishes so I'm not expecting a trough of food but cmon. Tonkotsu Ramen (14 dollars): Excellent, and finally some competition to Otaku South whose small portions/high prices defeat the whole purpose of why Ramen was created. The gold standard in the states is obviously David Chang's Momofuku Ramen which is around 16 and you are full when done. The ramen here had a healthy serving of well textured noodles with a good firmness and chew, the pork belly was crispy and fatty as expected, and the egg was perfectly cook. Asked for some Sriracha which they brought to me, don't know if they have any other ways to spice it up like chili oil. I'm not going to be a douche and mention every single country that I've eaten Ramen, and I'm not going to say I'm from San Fran or LA so the ramens good but not like out West...that will be said enough in the coming reviews.  All I know is that is was good and I will be eating it again. Hopefully they will have special ramens on certain nights. I didn't ask about adding anything to my bowl, but I imagine if you want to put some shrimp heads or something on top they wouldn't care. The waitress was great, and always checking on us even though it was a mad house. Once this initial crush is over I think this will be a great place to sit at the bar, have a couple of drinks, a bowl o'ramen and be more then satisfied.(I love using parentheses)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

A-Ok for the alcohol, we were lured in by Anchor old Foghorn on Tap, it's been 10 years since it was in Nashville.  The Tap menu is certainly interesting as are the cocktails, I had the shochu/ginger/pineapple tonic which at happy hour prices was $5.  So small I got two sips and that was it, tasty but no VFM. The menu cocktails were up to $12.  Pab's Foghorm was $6.  The place feels like Tavern or one of those M street vibes except everyone is wearing deer hunter bandanas,  we edged in with edamame, soo over salted, shishito peppers, a massive portion but not as good as the other places in town, a little more sauce needed.  We then had some happy hour rice thing, deep fried with tuna on top, words fail me on this one - I could not eat it.  Why did we not have ramen or yakitori , well because gut instinct said no, the choices did not seem appealing.All in all a little expensive, the vibe not for us, food mediocre.  Sure it brings something different to the east side and the place was packed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Possibly some soy sauce marinade? I don't know. But, I won't order it again. The ramen was great and I would like to try a couple other things on the menu. I really want this restaurant to be awesome. But, the salt issues really need to be addressed. Also, it's a new spot, so be prepared to make a reservation or wait a good long time.

    "comments": "When you have a hankering for Asian food, but just want a variety of small bites, what better place to go than an izakaya?  The wife and I are SO excited to welcome the first izakaya to Nashville!  Since Two Ten Jack bills itself as an izakaya and ramen house, we decided to stick with the staples.  Here we go:Chicken Kara-age (JFC): 4/5 stars.  Crispy without being greasy with very nice, flavorful seasoning.  Moist chicken underneath. Mayo-based negi (scallion) dip is a nice accompaniment. Biggest complaint is the small portion size for the given price. Takoyaki: 3/5 stars. Biggest disappointment of the night. To be fair, the menu does refer to it as a \"hush puppy\" which is an accurate description. We were hoping for the more authentic batter balls with octopus bits. Oh well. We did like the miso butter, though. Yakitori: 4.5/5 stars. We had the tsukune as well as the short rib skewers, and both were excellent!  The shichimi and yuzu kosho seasonings, respectively, were intense and flavorful without being overwhelming. The short rib was not as tender as the wagyu yakitori I've had before, but it was still quite good. My only complaints are that the meats were lacking the charcoal smoky flavor of the best yakitori and that it is a little more expensive than typical.Tonkotsu Ramen: 3.5/5 stars.  Since we've gotten here, we've been searching for a good bowl of ramen (Otaku South was quite the disappointment). While the ramen here is the best we've found in Nashville, it's still a far cry from the best ramen in SF or Vancouver.  The noodles are thinner than traditional noodles, but maintain the nice chewy consistency one would expect normally. The broth had a nice pork flavor, but was missing the rich undercurrents of additional flavoring found in the best of broths.  In addition, after finishing the bowl, we were left with the \"sticky lips\" feeling from too much gelatin in the broth.  The toppings, however, were fantastic!  The soy egg was flavored and cooked perfectly.  In addition, the roasted pork  was marinated and flavored as well as any other I've had.Overall, a nice addition to the Asian cuisine landscape of Nashville.  Though it tends to be a bit pricier than a traditional izakaya, the food highlights are in the seasonings and flavors of their meats as well as a decent (though not excellent) bowl of ramen. All in all, a decent outing, and we will be sure to return!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

So frustrating. Confusing also is that my Tonkatsu ramen ($14) did not look like the one pictured on this site--I only got one egg half and two pieces of pork...so not sure what is correct but there's definitely some randomness here too.The food *is* very good but I left feeling slightly violated--while the food was far above average I left feeling unfulfilled.  Maybe it was the prices or the portions or the uncomfortable seating or the not-level table (or some vague combination of all of those things) but while I didn't NOT enjoy myself, I can't say as I feel grateful for the experience either.  Will try again with altered expectations.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Awesome pizza! Freshly made dough, fresh ingredients and cooked in a brick oven. I had the vodka sauce pizza, which was amazing. The crust is thin so it's not super filling and you can eat more slices.Seating inside is limited, but you can also go to the carryout side and order a pizza to go.  They also have a few pizzas pre-made to try by the slice and grab a seat at the counter.Some of the best pizza I have ever had, and East Nashville neighborhood is an added bonus. Easy five star rating!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

On our adventure exploring East Nashville we stumbled across this pizza spot and boy did we hit the jackpot. The staff are all so sweet and attentive and the restaurant is very clean and well taken care of. The food is simply amazing I definitely recommend the garlic knots a meal is not complete at five points without the knots.. go grab a slice you won't regret it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Always a wait, which is a double-edged sword. Beautiful pizzas, variety, beer, and pleasant staff. It's a simple recipe for success. Being next to two popular bars also lends itself to being the drunken-munchie destination. Really enjoyed the garlic knots, even though the entire clove of garlic may have been a little too much. The pizza though... Affordable, nearly every ingredient is made in-house (which we specifically asked about) and just generally a true representation of what a thin-crust, New York-style pizza should taste like. Just a simple slice of heaven after a few drinks at the bar.This place doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. Just good pizza and a relaxed atmosphere. Service, at least at the time I went, was a little less than attentive; however, I can almost understand due to the place being constantly packed. Really good and cheap, just be sure to partake in a drink or two before hand to give you a little patience with the waitstaff. Very good overall though.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Now sure what meat they put on the pizza, but anyone who has ever had real Italian prosciutto will be very disappointed. They cheese however was tasty and the basil fresh-ish. The Parmesan it was topped with on the other hand tasted like the bottom shelf Costco brand. YikesThe reason why I gave 3 stars in the end were the dough balls, they were delicious, seasons nicely and came with a lovely dipping sauce on the side. Two thumbs up for that dish.Oh.... and somehow I ended up paying $30 for the pizza and dough balls. Prices I usually only see in LA... ^^\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our table of five was able to get they're garlic knots and a large pizza and still have leftovers.The garlic knots were more sense than breadsticks but had some great flavor and came with garlic butter, marinara and basil. It came with 7 which was more than enough for our gang.We followed up with a pizza that came out less than 10 minutes later. We got the T-Rex ( meat lover ) pizza. The sauce was fresh, the crust was flavorful, and the toppings were generous. The slices were thin cut which gave us better control on our portions because they were just so good!

    "comments": "I love finding more great places for a great meal in Nashville. One thing I love about my family is that we're generally all game for exploring and giving a new place a try. Last night was no different.First we started off with ice-cream at Pied Piper Creamery before dinner (because you know that just can't be done #notarule @EscapeAdulthood) but ended up staying around in East Nashville looking for a new place to try.We saw a few different people walking by us with pizza boxes and pizza started to sound better and better. We quickly pulled up Yelp on my phone and found Five Points Pizza was just around the corner.Based on the 45 minute expected wait it looked like this was going to be a pretty good place for picking up some pie! Expectations not disappointed!Sometimes pizza for my family can be a challenge. You see I'm adventurous and like to get some pretty interesting combinations, my wife can be a little adventurous and my kids usually prefer just a plain slice of cheese or pepperoni pizza. Five Points didn't disappoint because they offer NY style pizza by the slice or you can order some great specialty pizzas in a 14\" or 18\" size.My wife decided on the South Brooklyn (The Old World with an olive oil base, a full layer of pizza sauce, and basil baked in (no shredded mozzarella), my daughter got a single cheese slice (but wanted a 2nd before we left!), my son got a single pepperoni slice and I went with a slice of Meatball Pie (Fresh and shredded mozzarella, thinly sliced meatballs, red onions, garlic) and I believe a slice of Caprese (Sliced heirloom tomatoes, chopped basil, sweet house-made balsamic reduction, olive oil, fresh and shredded mozzarella (no tomato sauce) - but I think it also had some arugula and gargonzola cheese as well).You see in addition to the cheese and pepperoni by-the-slice, they seem to also have a couple of different daily options available. I started with the Meatball and it was delicious, not sure why I'd never really thought about thin-slicing some meatballs and adding them to a pizza but it was fantastic. I was actually a little surprised when I tried my 2nd slice and decided I liked it even more.We'll be adding this to our list of places to take friends and family when they visit and of course we'll be back again ourselves soon. I've definitely got to go back and try the Habanero Cream Sauce Pie! (House-made habanero cream sauce, bacon, oven-roasted grape tomatoes, red onions, roasted garlic, fresh basil, fresh and shredded mozzarella (no tomato sauce))A quick word on price, the individual slices of cheese and pepperoni were less than $4 each and were huge slices of pizza. My two specialty slices were both less than $5 each. So, overall some really tasty pizza for a great price.Note: ingredient descriptions in parenthesis taken directly from their website\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

However, since I don't think there is an Old Chicago in Nashville, It's OK to say that Five Points Pizza is the best tasting pizza that I've had in Nashville. The prices are reasonable and the pizzas are huge. I love that you can split a pizza with two different choices for each side. I like the different combinations as well as the speciality pizzas.

On the upside the staff seemed happy at their jobs which is refreshing. Our server was professional but didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  On first arrival at our table she was friendly, but by the end of the meal, I felt as though she was in a rush to get rid of us.When I spoke to the host about my disappointment in the broth, he advised that I should have told the server when the food came out so that they could have resolved it then.  So they seem to want to please their customer.  If I thought our server would have welcomed that kind of feedback, perhaps I would have told her.

I get the shishito peppers and crispy Brussels every time, and then I struggle to decide on crab butter noodles, ramen, or chirashizushi. Crab noodles have some kind of crack in them; ramen broth is incredibly flavorful; sushi rice is perfectly cooked. I went to NYC the other weekend and did an impromptu Japanese food crawl, but I just kept thinking about Two Ten Jack.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were told that they didn't seat until about 5, but online everywhere we read that they open at 4. It became even more awkward as we waited at the bar to be seated but no one cared. It's a little pricey here but the food was good. Portion sizes are a bit small for that price compared to an authentic Japanese place. I'll probably come again and give it another shot but not too likely.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "There are many glowing reviews here already talking about what a great place Two Ten Jack is, and frankly, I'm going to be one of them.  After looking at their website and thinking how delicious many of the dishes sounded, I rounded up a group of friends to go check it out.  Unfortunately they weren't taking reservations that night and initially told us it would be a one-and-a-half to two hour wait.  In reality, it only ended up being about a 40 minute wait and fortunately we waited it out while deliberating on going somewhere else.  I'm glad we stayed and ate at Two Ten Jack. First, the service was top rate.  Our server was super professional and very knowledgeable about both the food and drink items we asked about.  Our food began arriving within just a couple of minutes and the staff handled our party of nine without showing the least bit of exasperation.  The service was consistently quick, attentive, and pleasant.  In short, service was flawless. Not a single person in our party had any complaints about the food, and every dish I tried was flavorful, nicely prepared and presented.  I will say some dishes clearly offer more value for the money, but the quality of the food is all superior. I had the tsukune yakitori, the yellowtail/jalapeño/cilantro sashimi, and the garlic noodles.  The table shared the crispy brussels, Japanese fried chicken, the hatsu (chicken hearts), and potato fries.  All of these were remarkably flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  Some of the dishes are very small, but also with a reasonably small price.  The only dish I thought might be a little overpriced for the portion was the yellowtail sashimi, which was four thin slices of tuna about 1x2 inches for $10.  But it was delicious.  On the other end of that spectrum, the ramen dishes and the noodles offer generous portions for the price.  Two Ten Jack is the kind of place you'll find yourself sitting, lingering, ordering plate after plate, drink after drink, and sharing a memorable lively evening with friends or a loved one.  It's comfortable, enjoyable, and convivial. In other words, just what you expect from a friendly neighborhood pub. Overall, Two Ten Jack deserves a five star review, which I reserve for only a truly exceptional experience.  I'm looking forward to coming back often.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I love Japanese-ish food. I can't vouch for what authentic is but I believe they are making a good effort on most things. The ramen is very tasty but also very filling so you might not do well snacking on small plates or sushi before ramen which is sort of what they try to sell you on. Also the ramen doesn't travel to-go because the noodles lose their quality not long after going into the  broth. Expect to wait a while to get in. In my opinion this place is more about novelty and spending money. I'd rather just go to Koi and order a teriyaki bento. By the way, the chicken meatball yakitori tasted like a fish stick. The takoyaki tasted much more like a Drifters hushpuppy (but smaller) than any other takoyaki I've ever had (I think they are going for more of a hushpuppy than actually takoyaki which I think would be more of an Asian type batter). Edamame was good though, they had like a teriyaki or tarè sauce on them.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Came here for the ramen and was extremely disappointed. Ordered the Tonkotsu and the broth was so salty it was inedible. Nevermind that it had the consistency of water. The pork was nice; the egg was nicely cooked, but again, salty. The noodles, which are usually my favorite part, were so thin they lacked any texture. I ate two bites and couldn't go on which is only the 2nd time I've done that. The first was at Ma Peche in NY when we ordered an array of dishes, devoured every single one of them except a fried rice dish. The manager noticed we hardly touched it and came over to ask us if it was OK. This didn't happen at Two Ten Jack. Are they so regularly getting full bowls of ramen sent back to the kitchen that they're not even asking people if anything was wrong? I noticed the girl next to me sent her bowl back as well. I guess as long as there are people willing to eat mediocre food, places like Two Ten Jack will be packed for a long time to come.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Parking is a bitch, but that's a fact of life. It's a good lesson. Good things come to those who wait. That's another thing here. The waiting game. I hate it. But common sense, if you go during meal hours, you'll wait. I tend to go at 11 a.m. to beat the crowds. Rarely have I had to wait. There are a few times I've ordered side salads. They're not bad, but save your money as they are kind of pricey for their size. Indulge in garlic knots instead. They offer the knots in half and full orders. Personally I think a half order is stupid. Who does that? Get the full and take them home. Duh. The pizza is amazing. It's perfection. If you're in a hurry get a slice. They have a few standard slices every day as well as a slice of the day. Do it. If you have time to wait and want to prolong your experience at home get a whole damn pie. You won't regret it. Promise. Service is top notch. Seriously. Some times they're so busy it takes a few minutes to get service but they're competent so I don't care. I always see the owner buzzing around which makes me feel good.They also have a pretty decent beer selection, including locals. They have beer and slice specials too.

I Yelped places that were open and pizza by the slice sounded perfect - quick, cheap, and satisfying. This place is open late, has a walk up window after a certain hour. I ordered a slice of veggie pizza \"on a plate\" to eat right away and a slice of cheese to go (which was just pizza \"on a plate\", in a paper bag). The crust was thin and crispy; perfectly toasted for the perfect amount of crunch. I ate the slice of cheese cold the next day and it was still delicious. I would definitely go back here!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I recently attended a Nashville Food Bloggers event here. The owners were nice enough to close off the right hand side of the building and bring out pizza upon pizza for us to try. I tried the cheese (amazing), pepperoni (amazing) and a pepperoni, black olive, red onion and I think feta pizza (amazing and my fav). The staff was SUPER friendly and gave kitchen tours and even let us try to spin the dough with a rubber one they practice with. I love the decor and finishing of the restaurant. The left side has chairs and a bar and the right has some stools and counters. They even have a neat little walk up window if you want to get a slice on the go. I didn't look at the prices of the pizza, but I'd expect them to be reasonable. My only grips are about parking and price of the keg wine. I know parking in East Nashville is always a pain, but the night we went we had to park a few blocks away and walk. On the way back to the car I was thing it was all for the best because of the amount of pizza I ate. Secondly, the keg wine. As you're aware, I was at a special event and we were offered free pizza and half off beer on draft and keg wine. They have a butternut (white) and a troublemaker (red). I got the troublemaker and it came in a cute (small) little carafe with a glass on top. It was nice. It cost me $4.37, so full price would be $8.75. That seems a little pricey for a keg wine in a small glass.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's great for pick up or just to stop in, have a beer, and grab a slice.  They feature a few slices daily, which are always delicious.  As everyone else has said, the Garlic Knots are to die for. The Bianca is such a delicious white pie and the Woodstock Classic (pepperoni and mushrooms) and Dave's Pie (prosciutto, basil, pecorino romano) are easy favorites. Space is a little tight when it's crowded but it's 100% worth it. Great beer selection too.  Nothing beats a beer flight and a slice (and knots, obviously)!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This is what i envision a pizza joint in NYC to look like. Trendy neighborhood but with a mix of clientele from hipsters to families. Busy for a Thursday night but we only waited about 20 minutes. Mitch was our server and he was great. Personable and interested in learning a little about us but still getting the job done. The Spinach salad was fresh and the dressings made in house, in fact all of the salads I saw come out looked good. My husband is a pizza snob so when he told me I wouldn't like it (haha) I knew it had to be good. And it was very good. The crust crispy and chewy, sauce just enough without being too saucy, cheese and pepperoni ratio spot on. Highly recommend you check this joint out.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We went for a late lunch/early dinner around 4:00. We walked in and I immediately noticed there wasn't a huge difference between the temperature outside and inside. We were seated with no wait, but I wish I had requested a table farther into the restaurant because the sun was beating in through the window. We ordered garlic knots and they were delish! We got half supreme, half vodka sauce pie... and both were just okay. I wasn't a huge fan of their no substitution rule! We might visit again, but we might see if there are any rivals in the area first!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "***Five Points is a good New York style pizza spot; it is located in a very hipster part of Nashville***Nashville has many neighborhoods and a lot of them have their own feel.  East Nashville is a very hipster, Portland-esque part of Nashville.  There is a fun little collection of small and unique shops housed in little bungalow-esque buildings.  There are also quite a few casual eateries in this area focusing on housemade food at reasonable prices.  Five Points is one of these eateries.Five Points does not have the farm to table approach of many Portland restaurants (or maybe it just does not advertise that approach on its menu), but this pizza spot does showcase pizzas with housemade toppings as well as lots of beers in a rustic and casual atmosphere that has kept a lot of the previous building's brick and pipes exposed.Pizza can be made to order as big pies or you can order by the slice.  They have a few always on the menu slices like cheese and pepperoni as well as some daily specials written on the chalkboard that feature interesting ingredients like habanero cream sauce.Their pizza by the slice is good.  Their pizzas are big New York style thin crust pizzas that have a little bit of crispiness but also a good fold--great cheese and tomato sauce too.  If Five Points was in Los Angeles, it would be one of the best spots for New York style pizza.  It is less greasy than Mulberry and the crust is not too crispy like the crust at Joe's.  It is similar to Vito's on La Cienega; it might even be better than Vito's.I also tried their stromboli.  This is baked to order and calzone-esque (they have a few choices and they are inspired by some of their pizzas).  I went with their sliced meatball, which also came with red onion, melted mozzarella and marinara sauce on the side.  The bread was great; its was similar to a garlic knot. The bread had a great crispy crust that was also buttery while the center of the stromboli was soft.There was a lot of mozzarella too as well as a generous portion of sliced meatballs.  I wish the sliced meatballs were full meatballs so I could have had a more true meatball experience, but the meatballs were still moist and had a good flavor.  The well-seasoned, nicely chunky and not-too-sweet marinara sauce was necessary to balance out the overwhelming amount of melted mozzarella. Service was good--friendly, attentive and quick.Prices were reasonable.  The stromboli was $8 and it was more than enough for two people (as long as you also order a salad to split).  Their pizza by the slice prices were just okay, but the slices were also very generous portions.Five Points is a good pizza spot and it is one of the easiest places to get into on a Sunday afternoon in this area (Marche Artisan Foods was incredibly busy).  I am not sure how Five Points rates against other Nashville pizza spots, but it would definitely be popular in Los Angeles.  If you are looking to find the best pizza in Nashville, Five Points has to be one of the places you try.Free street parking is available in the nearby residential area.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Went with a coworker and we each got a local cider on draft (Roots Hard Cider - good), garlic knots, and an 18 inch pizza. We should have gone with the 14 inch, though. We had 3 slices left. The garlic knots were delicious and the pizza was some of the best pizza I've ever had. We split the pizza half Dave's Pie and half T-Rex. LOVED Dave's Pie. Highly recommend that one. I didn't personally try the T-Rex, but my coworker said it was really good. Will be coming back if I'm in Nashville again!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We walked in the quick slice to go side, not even realizing that there was a sit down option next door. I might have enjoyed a cold beer with my pizza if I knew we could dine in. The to-go side was packed and with no place to sit down so we ended up eating in the car. However, this pizza really was amazing. Perfectly thin crust pizza with high quality toppings. I had the vege pizza of the day which included vodka sauce, onions, mushrooms, spinach and fresh basil on top of the cheese. Really worth going back to again and again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Excellent selection of TN and various microbrews on draft.  Our waitress was great with suggestions on beer and pizza options. They focus on specialty pizzas with various unique sauces and toppings. The nice thing is you can split a pie in half and do one specialty on one half and another on the other half. We got half Vodka Sauce pizza and half T-Rex. Both were awesome, TRex was my fave. The garlic knots appetizers are good but a little too much garlic for all of our party (although we still ate them all ). If u are in the area or not, its worth making a trip to stop by for some DGP.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Service was good and pricing is comparable to the area. Unique beer on drought so ask for samples. As usual parking in Nashville is a pain.

The crust is flavorful, crispy, and chewy. All the toppings were evenly spread out. It was served hot and fresh. Every bite was an explosion of flavor and texture.

I love their Bianca pizza (basically extreme cheese bread), while my husband likes plain ole pepperoni. The great thing about Five Points is that they will happily split the pie in half. They also offer great lunch specials. For $8, you can get 2 of their daily slices and a drink; for $9 you can get a 1/2 order of knots (five delicious garlic knots), a salad and a drink; or for $9 you can get a slice of pizza and a salad.As a note, I prefer their full pies to their slices because I feel as though they can sometimes dry out. Let's be honest though, the slices are still pretty good. The slice window is open late night, and they also serve up some great beers.

We stumbled upon Five Points and l was super happy to have food in my belly! The pizza was very good and we really enjoyed the beer flights. I have to give it 4 stars because I was sweating like a pig the entire time trying to enjoy my dinner. We sat the bar so I guess it's because we were closer to the kitchen. Also, the bartender was a little short and not that \"sociable\" I guess. Either way, that was pretty much the only non-enjoyable aspects of this restaurant!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My definition of pizza is New York Style is the only pizza for me, Chicago Style isn't a pizza its a casserole, and then there's American pizza (Your ketchup flavored marinara with cheddar cheese and cardboard crust with canned toppings) then you have your specialty pizza with the crazy toppings which is fine for most Gentiles. The restaurant is typical small New York spot of which has not a lot of seating but is adequate. They seat you by taking your cell and calling you when a table is available. The few times I have been there, multiple tables are open and freshly cleaned by which no one is sat at them for 15-20 minutes minimum. So you stand by the bar looking at 3-4 empty tables betting which table you will get sat at. When you are finally called the service is great, and the food comes out promptly.I recommend getting the knots a large pie and some cold beers you won't be disappointed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Incredible! Five Points gets Five Stars and it's a no brainer. Quality is everything at this pizza joint located in the Five Points section of the trendy East Side of Nashville. The sit down space itself is pretty small, so be prepared for a wait. However, I've never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time.Five Points Pizza has a great selection of local beers that always seems to be rotating. It's a good place to sample the local craft brews that Nashville has an abundance of. The garlic knots are fantastic and a good way to kick off your meal. Once again, quality is everything and it's very obvious that everything made here is done so using high quality ingredients. The crust always tastes fresh, the sauce is amazing and the toppings are really good. Even when the sit down section of the restaurant closes, the walk up window is still open late offering slices. If you're hanging out at one of the late night hot spots on the East Side, it's definitely convenient. The prices are a little more than what you would pay for one of the big pizza chains, but trust me, it's worth every penny.Five Points Pizza is the first restaurant that we take anyone visiting us in Nashville to eat. Hands down, the best pizza I've found in the city!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but there are a few things that make this place special... one is the atmosphere and location. Five Points is a cool area and the vibe in the restaurant reminds me a ton of all the little pizza parlors I used to go to growing up. The second thing that sets Five Points Pizza apart is simple - the Prosciutto & Basil pizza. You can get a whole pie of this, or get it by the slice. But either way... oh my lord. It's really delicious. The regular and the pepperoni are both serviceable - and I would MUCH rather go here than say Papa Johns or Pizza Hut. I would probably give this place 3 and a half stars if that were an option. But 4 stars seems appropriate enough. If you're in Nashville and you want something resembling good NY pizza, this is a pretty good place to start.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Next we ordered the small Dave's pie which arrived very quickly, super hot & tasted amazing. Shoutout to our server Carrie who kept our drinks full despite the rush & had great energy the whole time.

Wait staff was great, price was also reasonable, and the garlic knots (although not as mind blowing as the pie) were more than legit.

As someone from the Northeast, I'm familiar with a lot of different types of slices and the ones at Five Points are certainly good, but if you've ever had a large slice before you're probably not going to be blown away. Furthermore, I expected more from the garlic knots as they were a bit dry. Again, they were good, but I've had better, and wouldn't get them again. The location was fine, but it's a pizza place, the venue isn't going to make or break the experience.

Buttery, garlicky basil goodness served with a hot dish of fresh marinara. Since we are carnivores we had to get the T-Rex but add prosciutto. This pizza isn't for the recent coronary patient. (I recently had to visit a cardiologist but learned I have perfect heart health.) My friend stayed the driver so I could sample some local brews. There were a few Nashville beers on tap and even a Huntsville brew (not a great one though).Come here for local food, beer, and a funky vibe mixing NYC and East Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Hot, fresh, and the fresh basil and minced garlic really just brought some amazing flavors to the game.  The marinara sauce is freshly prepared and tastes like real tomatoes... Not something out of a can.  The pizza was great!  Enough for myself and my husband for two meals.  The meat was high quality, tender, and delicious.  The sauce, again, was fresh, sweet, and spiced just right.  Next to DeSano's Bakery, Five Points is my favorite pizza place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's great that they sell by the slice, have a late night window and the staff is friendly. Props to their business model (except for the lack of gluten free options), but I have to say it was pretty overrated. Maybe it's because I grew up on different pizza in NJ/NY and nothing can compare to V&T's back in the day, or because most people I know only eat here when they are drunk, but I'd say the crust is not worth the migraine if I don't already have one and the flavors are decent at best (the sauce really makes or breaks a pizza for me).

    "comments": "We stumbled upon this place in search of Sunday night dinner after discovering so many of the places on our Nashville must-try list are closed Sundays. When we walked in, the place was packed! The friendly hostess was cleaning off a table and told us it would be 10-15 minutes for a table for two, but smiled and said it wouldn't be too long. We waited outside and it seemed to be only a matter of 5 minutes when she stepped outside to grab us. I'm not a beer fan, but this place seems to carry a large selection and wide variety of beer. For only $7, you can order a beer flight--four beers of your choice. What a deal!On to the food--we started off with an order of garlic knots. Honestly, I don't even like bread much, but after seeing everyone's steaming garlic knots arrive at their tables, I knew I had to have some! The garlic knots were good but not excellent--some pieces were very hard and not the softer, light texture you would expect. The knots were also sitting in a pool of olive oil, and I'm not sure if that's ever cool. Maybe it was an off-order, but I would probably save the calories next time. We also ordered the spinach gorgonzola salad: Baby spinach topped with mushrooms, red onions, walnuts, dried cranberries and gorgonzola--pretty straightforward and hard to mess up, pretty good. Based on the server recommendation, we chose a half-and-half pizza: the server's personal favorite, the vodka sauce pie: Fresh mozzarella, house-made vodka tomato cream sauce, spinach, mushrooms, red onions, prosciutto di Parma, garlic, chopped basil, pecorino romano (no tomato sauce) and supreme: Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, mushrooms, red onions, green peppers. The vodka sauce pie is very, very delicious--you can barely taste the house-made vodka sauce because its flavor is bursting with so many other ingredients! The fresh basil and prosciutto are the highlights of this pie. I did have one concern with the pizza--in some parts, I noticed a doughy consistency under the ingredients, which might be an indication that the pizza was slightly undercooked. Not willing to chance it, I only ate one slice of this pizza. The supreme is also delicious, although a tad salty from the combination of pepperoni and Italian sausage. However, it seemed more cooked than the other half. You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients in both pizzas. This place was a good pick and I'm glad we accidentally stumbled here for a meal! Is it the best pizza and garlic knots I've ever had? Hardly. Does it pass for the best pizza in Nashville? Very likely!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I love that they give you so many options to grab a slice. They also offer a great daily special slice, both in meat and vegetarian options. I've had their veggie pizza with vodka sauce and fresh basil and it was hands down one of THE best slices I've ever had, and I lived in New York for a few years. Their whole pies are massive; I ordered a half pesto and half Supreme pie in 18\" for Mother's Day and it was huuuuuge. Their pizza is fresh, hot, and delicious and made with high quality ingredients. Five Points' fresh basil game is on point. I have to say, though, that my favourite thing is the garlic knots: golden all over, crispy on the bottom, doughy and exquisite in the center, tossed in really good olive oil and lots of garlic and Parmesan, topped with fresh basil, and served with a side of their amazing marinara. They were so, so, SO good. I felt like I had major garlic breath for at least the next few hours, but it was absolutely worth it. My mom and I split a large order of garlic knots and ordered an 18\" pie for Mother's Day....I would suggest splitting some knots and just ordering a slice or two each. They're very filling. Those garlic knots are SO STUPID GOOD that I would literally physically assault someone if they tried to take one away from me.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Their meat options are limited to pepperoni and meat ball so for those who do cannot eat that the veg options one hell of a bite to eat.Always start off with the Garlic knots and you will not be dissapointed, they come out fresh and with some sauce which you cannot stop eating at all and will forget that you ordered a pizza.Great job guys and hell of a atmosphere with great food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This place does it right with their own hand, crushed Roma sauce that provides a perfect layer to build on, and doesn't rob, or overpower any of the pie.

I'd heard of Five Points Pizza almost as soon as I moved to a nearby neighborhood. I've been a faithful customer ever since.If you decide to brave 5Points on a Friday, know this: come early. If you arrive by 7 with more than 2 people, you're already too late. Either do as the old folks do (points to self) and plan your dinner outing at 6:30, come solo or plan on eating late (if you decide to eat in). Like bees to a hive, hipsters the mid-South 'round congregate on this pizzeria and they.never.leave. Seriously. Trying to get some breathing room in this place is a journey but it's worth it. Do as I do and come early. Get a table and start thinking about the beer you're going to try. Pizza and beer is a match made in heaven and 5Points makes sure that match is well done. Something I love about the beer list is that it isn't all hops all the time. Nashville, as a beer lover and connoisseur, I beg of you: lay off the hops. There are other elements to consider when drinking beer. Expand your horizons. Here, take advantage of the well-curated list and enjoy any one of a number of local delights (tasted by first Czanns here), poppy imports (Stiegl rocks my summer world) and, most importantly, browns, stouts and other dark beers. But don't get too full on beer; you're here to eat. I ordered the famous garlic knots... and I could have left them. While I'll never shy away from hot, crispy, buttery bread, I didn't pick up the 'garlic' part of the knot. I saw them. I felt them on my tongue. But, I didn't taste them. Save your stomach real estate for the pie. The style here is more typical of NYC so expect wide, floppy slices with distinctive, chewy crust and light sauce. I split my pizza between a Zeus (pepperoni, capicola, black olives, banana peppers, red onions, and feta) and a Supreme (pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, red onions, and green peppers). To be expected, both sides were awesome but the combo was even more so. The ingredients are fresh, the cook takes pride in his work (coming out to visit the tables) and the dish is served piping hot on a tray with a pie server. Perfect. I have also grown fond of their stromboli (the marinara sauce is addictive).What takes 5Points over the edge, though, is the management. When you're on top of the food chain, you don't always have incentive to do right by your customers. I came in one night to pick up a medium veggie pizza. Coming at the time quoted, I picked up the pie and discovered it was cold. The fellow working the take out room couldn't be bothered to give any [redacteds]. Despite my reservations, I left. I got home and couldn't bring myself to eat a 'fresh' cold pizza. I called back and asked to speak to a manager. After a while (and initially speaking with no-[redacteds] lad, I got Josh on the phone. He apologized, asked if I lived nearby and offered to make another pizza for me, free of charge. He asked the type and size, gave me a time to be there and apologized again. I arrived at the right time, asked for Josh, shook his hand, heard him apologize AGAIN, and received a large veggie pizza for my troubles.This. This is the reason Nashville loves 5 Points. Josh saved the day. The food is fantastic. The business makes good sense. All you other pizza joints, take notice. The microphone has been dropped.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ordered the following items just to see how they stacked up:1.) slice of Pepperoni Pizza - this was delicious, just enough sauce, on a perfectly cooked crust, which had a nice crunch... The pepperonis were layered nicely (real pepperonis) and enough cheese! This was so good from start to finish!!!2.) order of the garlic knots- I am a lover of all things garlic, and this by far the moment I got my take home order (this) is all I could smell... GARLIC & BASIL... It made my drive home so difficult because I wanted to dig in and start my feasting lol... Trust me you want to order theses bad boys! For a full order @ only $5.00 you will regret leaving them behind.3.) 14\" T-Rex pizza - boy I am glad I ordered the 14\" instead of 18\" this pizza is huge!!! The flavor is even bigger! Full of meats and cheese... This is what you call pizza! I have always loved Joeys house of Pizza and I still do and always will! But this place is a for sure stop and eat! (Skip) Pizza Hut, papa johns, and dominos! You get a better deal here and fresher ingredient!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Five Points Pizza is the best option for dine-in (or carryout) pizza in East Nashville, and potentially in Nashville.My girlfriend and I went around 7pm on a beautiful Friday evening, expecting any restaurant to have a bit of a wait. We walked into to a fully seated restaurant (though there weren't any spare bodies mingling and taking up space) and were greeted by a friendly hostess. She said the wait was 45 minutes for 2, took our name and cell number, and told us we should feel free to go anywhere in the neighborhood in the meantime. I appreciate this dual-purposed crowd control tactic and neighborhood promotion. We popped next door for a drink and appetizer while we waited.About 45 minutes later, we were seated. The long and narrow floorplan is small and cozy, but has a nice vibe with tall wooden ceilings. Our friendly, on-point server greeted us with waters, and we ordered from their beer list, which featured a nice selection of local and seasonal draughts (each listing included helpful descriptions!), as well as a slew of bottle and can options.For pizza, you can order by the slice or pie, creating your own or choosing from a number of specialties. The topping list was above average, including fresh jalapeños, always a good indicator of produce quality. We had it narrowed down to a few pies, and our server made decisive, efficient recommendations, including telling us that you can split specialty pies 50/50 at no extra charge. So we tried the meatball on one half and the hot Hawaiian on the other. Both were delicious.The pizza here is very good, and (now, after multiple visits) it may be my favorite in Nashville. The dough and crust here have more of a cornmealy crunch than my other favorite pizza spots in town (DeSano and Mafiaoza's). But it's hard to compare, because each is prepared in a different style with different ingredients.If you're looking for something quick, don't bank on getting a table right away. But if you're looking for a quality dine-in pizza experience in Nashville, Five Points Pizza is one of your best options.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Maybe congratulations would have been better?  Screw it.  I'm not a poet anyway.  But really - that pretty much summed it up.  The garlic knots and the pizza was incredible.  I am very, very proud of the Nashville food scene.  And I am REALLY proud of the fact that we have such good pizza here.  Many cities have just chain pizzas or average independent pizza places.  I have tried to come here before a long time ago.  If you read my reviews you'll know that I am part of a dinner club and we go out to eat once a week.  One day several months ago - we picked Five Points Pizza.  We went on a tuesday.  Come to find out - they are closed on Tuesday.  So, that time we ended up just going next door to Tenn-Sixteen and fell in love with the place.  We always get together on tuesdays because it seems to work best for most people.  Except this week.This time around - it was accidental that we ended up at Five Points Pizza.  We decided this week to go out to Mellow Mushroom for their 40th anniversary which was on a Wednesday instead.  They had super cheap beers, super cheap pizzas.  Basically - they were dusting off the 1974 Menu and whatever items they had and whatever prices they had then - they would be selling for one night only.  When we arrived - the crowd was insane.  It was pouring rain. We still wanted pizza - but decided that - since we were out on Wednesday and hadn't tried Five Points Pizza yet - that we would caravan to east Nashville and try it out.When they got use seated (which took a few minutes - after all there were 9 of us)- the server came over and started taking drink orders very promptly.  Then once everyone had their drinks/beers - they took our food orders.  They got appetizers and salads out BEFORE they brought the pizza.  And I have to say - the Garlic Knots were the best I've had.  The salads, although I didn't have one - looks great!  Finally - they bring out the slices of pizza.  And I have to say - these were in the true New York style.  Huge slices of pizza and they were very foldable.  But, I have to say - it was better than any New York slice I've had.  Lots of pepperoni, just enough sauce and cheese.  It really was a triumph!  Honestly - Its been less than 24 hours since we left Five Points Pizza and I already can't wait to go back.  Maybe this weekend?  Who wants to join for a slice?  Hippopotamus\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This is how NY pizza is done in NY. You can buy slices or pies to eat there or to go. The slices are a bit bigger than the traditional NY Italian pizzeria, but I'm not complaining. Great atmosphere, the pizza is great for NY pizza outside of New York City and Long Island. Much better than other Midwestern places that try to emulate a New York pizzeria. Felt like I was back home on Long Island already. Try the garlic knots, they are amazing and generously sized with a bowl of dipping marinara sauce that is equally as delicious. Good beer selection too. The location did feel a bit out of place and the parking in the back sucks. Otherwise, it was worth the drive from Murfreesboro to start a night in Nashville. I found the fact that it's a NY style pizzeria that is named Five Points in an area of Nashville called Five Points, quite funny. I'll have to find a pizzeria in Five Points Brooklyn with the same name now when I visit home.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "First off, I don't know how they did it, but the beer there tastes better than anywhere I've ever had beer on tap, and I've been to plenty of places that just opened.The pizza - decent tasty toppings, seemed a little healthy feeling. Not sure if they didn't use oil or baked the fat right out of it or what but it felt like it needed a braising with some olive oil to reduce the slightly crackery texture. Not bad mind you, just a pizza that makes you want water shortly after. The pizza was solid, enjoyable, not quite perfected but feeling like they're on the right path (had some of theirs before they opened and thought they were on the wrong path then). $22 for a large pie you won't be ashamed of, that will work.The garlic knots - there are only two places I have been in Nashville that I've had garlic knots that were almost right. This is one of them. Main complaint is the ones I used to love in NY universally had chunks of fresh garlic pasted on by butter or something... mmm... 5 Points had the knot part solid, but the garlic was a little underwhelming.As we went to pay we noticed the checkbooks were provided by Discover.. I should have known we were in an alternate reality at that point... I was trying to pay with my American Express and was told they did not accept them. I'm completely used to places not wanting to take AMEX, but to take Discover... it was like I was paying in the mid to late nineties... k-razy.Pizza survived the night with no refrigeration, tasted quite decent the next day. This is perhaps 3 steps away from being the best pizza I've ever had, however these are some significant steps, but I think they're heading in the right direction.Place appeared to be kid friendly, and the waiters were cool.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Nice decor, nice vibe. We had some AMAZING garlic knots at the bar, along with what is the best hard cider on tap that I've ever had. I think it was called Bold Rock. Pizza was a little soggy when we got to it, the crust honestly tasted a little undercooked. We got an Old World and loved everything but the sausage we added to it. The fresh basil had the perfect amount of spice to it, it is put on the side, not baked in. It was definitely not good the next morning (as pizza usually is.) A pretty mediocre but not terrible pizza experience, but I'd probably give something else a try next time.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The hostess told me that Tomato Fest is the busiest day of the year for Five Points yet their pizza and their service remained on point.  They offer some unusual toppings as well as all the old favorites.  We ordered the Zeus and subbed the capicola for some sausage and it was delicious!   The table next to us had the Garlic Knots and they looked tempting.  I will definitely try those next time we are in the area along with on of their Chocolate Chip Cannolis. mmmmm\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Awesome.Update:  I've been back SEVERAL times since the new slice window has opened, and I have to say that 5 Points is better than ever.  I like ordering single slices better than a whole pie- they get so much crispier with the par-bake.  I still can't say enough good things about this place.  Hands down, best pizza in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's so great to have found a place that makes a great pie!  Now if only we can find a good bagel...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We ordered the \"Old World,\" and added pepperoni. Listen y'all - this thing was OFF THE CHAIN! Honestly, Five Points is now in my top five favorite pizza places (in any city).There was going to be a crazy wait, so we ordered to-go, but they were nice and let me order a beer while we waited.

Our favorite was definitely the T-Rex... (And if I'm being completely honest with you all, we had a bad case of munchies when we got home from dinner/bars, and ordered 2 additional T-Rex pizzas...on the same night...). But the Bianca was also good, and I was personally a fan of the habanero cream pizza, which could have used a bit more spice in my opinion.  Anyway, if you're looking for a chill place with great pizza, you must try it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The Yelp service truly shines for me when a road tripper can locate a place like this.Walking in, the tiny little pizza parlor atmosphere was an indicator of good things to come. Reading the reviews, of course I ordered the garlic knots.  I was really excited for them, having only ever experiencing garlic knots before in NYC. Well the hype is true folks. Decadent and delicious, you could make a meal out of them alone. They had a variety of local beers to choose from and the one I tried was great, especially paired with the knots.The grownups ordered a vodka sauce pizza. Who knew something like this existed? It was great, even as leftovers the next day. Everything on it tasted so fresh. For the kids, we ordered individual slices of NY style pizza. They were large and fold-able, and it was funny to watch the children eat giant pizza slices. Speaking of children, they were well catered to when the waitress offered pizza dough to play with. Think of sticky playdough and you get the picture. I have only been one other place that does this, and forgot how entertaining it was for the kids.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Recently I took some friends (a group of fellow Judges, you might say) to Five Points so they could experience and critique this place with me.   Matthew loved the wide selection of specialty pizzas.  Mark raved about the crust.  Luke rocked the salad (that was a sight).   John noted that they are very generous with their toppings.  Ruth's fav was the Gorgonzola.  (I should note that Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther were unable to join us as they were attending a pig roast & shrimp hoedown in Shelbyville.)We came to Five Points Pizza with one express purpose: to eat awesome pizza.  After all, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, eh?   And so we did.  Trust me, this pizza will be a Revelation to your mouth.  Never have greater Acts of pizza-making been accomplished than those performed here!I must also mention the Five Points server named Cain.  He is Abel to provide outstanding and entertaining service from the Genesis of your dining experience until you finally make your Exodus from this fine establishment. And believe me, you will go out the door singing the happiest Song of Solomon.  You will not be counting Numbers and worrying about the price you paid.  There will be no Lamentations for you, only rejoicing!If ever I were to build a Pizza Kingdom of my own, Five Points is The Rock upon which I would build said Kingdom.  Woe unto you if you do not eat pizza (and salad) at Five Points Pizza.  I'm not calling myself a Prophet (either minor or major), but I predict you will love this place.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So, we've been here several times now, and I feel like I'm doing them a disservice, since I haven't  given them a review yet. 5PP is hands down the best non-wood/coal fired pizza I've had in Nashville. I love all types of pizza, but my preference is wood/coal fired, so I tend not to compare them to those that are cooked in a gas oven, it wouldn't be fair. That being said, 5PP makes one hell of a pie. What they lack in fuel, they make up for with fresh toppings, great sauces, inventive combinations and excellent crust. The crust is what I look at above everything, and they do it right: thin and crispy with a light char(a must), and a crisp yet chewy outer crust.All the slices I've had here have been home runs. The go to Cheese and Pepperoni slices are perfect, with the Pepperoni being just greasy enough and very good quality. The Prosciutto & Basil is another great slice if you're looking for something lighter but still packed with flavor. The whole pies are cooked to order and have yet to disappoint. The T-Rex(think meat lovers on steroids), Meatball Pie, Hot Hawaiian(pineapple/jalapeno/capicola), Supreme, Caprese...all amazing.Their Stromboli's are just as good, if that's what you're into. They're made with the same fresh dough and toppings, with a side of marinara(house made I assume). I've only had the Zeus(Pepperoni, spicy capicola, black olives, banana peppers, red onions, feta) and it was delicious and not small, haha. Our sever was amazed that I was able to eat one and a slice of pizza. Well, he obviously doesn't know me very well.If you're really hungry, don't skip the Garlic Knots, but they are filling, so try to get a half order if you can't resist.  I like to save as much room for the pizza as possible, so that's just me. If you're still hungry after going trough a few slices, they do make some pretty good cannolis also. I would ask about availability though, the last time we ordered them they were out.The service is always very friendly and inviting. The servers pay you just enough attention and the food comes out quickly. They have a great beer selection too, so it's not a bad place to start the night, or end it, or hell..both.I'm really glad that 5PP popped up, it's nice to have such great quality pizza so close to home.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Never let our glasses go empty. We ordered a 14\" half cheese and half pepp/much. It was delicious. Perfectly cooked and we got our food fast.

We sat and examined the menu and ordered the garlic knots and the large Zeus pizza. When it arrived in about 15-20 mins everything was hot and ready to eat lol... I took a bite into the garlic knots and they were so fluffy and light with the marinara sauce and the PIZZA my God was good. The crust had a nice crunch to it and the toppings were spot on. We also had a craft beer flight which was pretty good. Pizza was made to go with a nice cold beer. Overall this place I would say is a must even if you just get a simple pepperoni or cheese through the serving window outside. I will def be back to try the other pizzas.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Luckily the hostess was super accommodating and took down my phone number and said we could go to the bar next door and she would call me when our table was ready. The table became available before we had finished our drinks, but they saved it for us anyways which I really appreciated. We ordered some wine and garlic knots to start out. Our table of 4 originally started to order individual glasses of wine and the waitress told us it would actually be a better deal (cheaper and more wine) to get the carafes instead, which again I appreciated! The garlic knots were super but the real stand out was Dave's Pie, pizza with basil and proscuitto. Its also just as good cold the next day, I might even prefer it cold. The staff is really friendly and engages with your table, but not too much. The pizza comes out quickly and its a fun, lively environment.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The pizza was a delicious mess, I don't know how else to say it; not to say it wasn't a well made pizza but it was kind of thrown out there. I got a meatball and red onion slice and it was a terrific bunch of toppings on there-not neatly arrayed or anything but had plenty of meat and veggies to satisfy me (side note, I did eat elsewhere 15-20 minutes prior) and I thought it was terrific. They're open pretty late but we walked in a little before closing time and I didn't even know it-we weren't rushed or anything and they cleaned up around us without giving us the stink eye. In fact, one of us made the last minute decision to eat a slice and our waiter was nice enough to check if they had any left-even let us know that since they were about to close it might be too late. Thankfully, they hadn't tossed it out yet and were able to be served. Good, late night grease spot and surprisingly good late night service. Nice!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Five Points Pizza is just the right spot when I'm looking for dine-in pizza and beer, minimal strings attached. If ordering to my house, I'll likely choose a less expensive option, but this is a fun atmosphere with high quality food and service.Usually one standard slice will suffice: cheese, pepperoni, and prosciutto & basil; special slices are also worth exploring, in the name of variety. Garlic knots might seem redundant in preceding more sauce and dough, but they're so wonderful that it's hard to say no. Sometimes I wish there would be more light appetizers offered, but the knots keep me coming back.The best dish from the menu that I've tried is the stromboli--two of us shared the Zeus. Baked perfectly with a crunchy exterior and oozing interior of meats, vegetables, and cheeses, this thing is amazing. Like it will amaze you. For a while.Beer selection is good; servers and bartenders are happy to explain what's available.Check out the weekday happy hour and lunch specials--you know I love a good bargain.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The nicest thing about Five Points upon first walking in is its atmosphere, and this is where it trumps most other pizzerias in Nashville; it isn't trying too hard to be hip, but it's not scared to look like it is. The lights are dimmed, and the lofty dining room is illuminated with a flurry of Christmas lights. It's always busy--that's a good sign--but it has made for a reasonable wait every time I've been there. Once you sit down and manage to decide whether you want stromboli or pizza (you can't go wrong with either, but the stromboli option is a nice one to have), the night chugs along well in the hip, cozy restaurant. The garlic knots are well-presented, though there are better ones in the city, and there's a nice selection of beers to keep you entertained until the food comes.Finally, the pie is brought out, and you look upon it with starving eyes (by this point you've been in the restaurant for upwards of a half an hour). When you take your first bite, you notice that it isn't the most authentic New York pizza: the sauce is a little too sweet for that. The amount of body gives each bite a nice, full texture. And the toppings, much like those of the rest of Nashville's hippest pizzerias, tend to lean toward artisan-style.Five Points probably isn't unlike any pizza you've ever had. But it doesn't have to be: it's a high quality slice, and it's my favorite pizza in town, well worth the trek to East Nashville. Do yourself a favor and drop by on a cold Friday night.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

So, this should help to break that habit.Yelp defines a 3-star rating as A-OK, which is how I see this place, probably even 3 and a half, but I wouldn't go as far as to say I am a fan and give it 4 stars.I would definitely eat here again, not anytime soon because I love trying new things, but certainly at some point. The garlic knots were tasty, the pizza was good, the booths were spacy, the restrooms were clean, and the prices were fair. But there wasn't anything that overly impressed me. I would say everything was \"A-ok.\" Any real food critic has to dine somewhere multiple times, at varying times of day and sample close to everything on the menu before writing a review. However I ordered a single pizza and appetizer, and am giving you my two cents. If this place had less reviews I would feel guilty only giving it three stars, but I think it can handle my honesty.Hopefully this review doesn't discourage anyone from eating here, if you take away anything from this it is that I encourage you to eat here and enjoy it. It will be a fine meal if you like NY style pizza, but thats all it will be, a meal--not some out of this world food \"experience\".\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We also ordered the garlic knots, which you can order a half or whole order of. The server thoughtfully showed us what a half order looked like by pointing to another table's order, so we knew that a half order would be plenty for the two of us. it was all delicious and quick, not to mention very reasonably priced.

Were you expecting more?  I mean, it was really good lemonade, but... it's lemonade - what'd you expect me to do, throw a parade?Ok - the pizza.  The first thing that I said when it was put in front of me was \"Holy crap, that's a lot of prosciutto!\"Yes, I said that.  Out loud.  The other people at the bar looked at me with vague amusement... or possibly apprehension...  At any rate, they do indeed put a ton of prosciutto on their slices (I carry a scale with me at all times - body issues - I don't want to talk about it) and it's high quality prosciutto.  Just the right amount of saltiness, just the right amount of fat, and melt in your mouth tender.  Really excellent.BUTIt was cold.  Not the slice - that was hot, but the prosciutto was cold.  Now, I'm not used to pizza in Nashville, so maybe not putting the prosciutto on the slice till after it comes out of the oven is a regional \"thing\"?  Whatever.  It wasn't a big deal.  All I had to do was let the pizza sit for a minute and the hot slices warmed the prosciutto, so certainly not the end of the world, but the first bite was a little jarring.The crust was... I'm going to go ahead and say it, a little brittle for my tastes.  You can tell they use quality dough by the flavor, but a slice should not crack when you try to fold it in half - it should have a little give to it - could just be it was just slightly overcooked, but other than that, the crust was tasty.The sauce was really good, delicate with a nice fresh tomato flavor and no hint of the sugary sweetness that many sub par pizzas have. BUT I could have used a little more of it.  Again, maybe it's a \"thing\" to not use much sauce on the prosciutto slice, but I think a smidge more sauce would have balanced out the overall flavor - methinks it might have also solved the brittle crust issue.There is no mozzarella on this slice, which is as it should be, but it does contain a healthy dusting of grated parmesan, which compliments the prosciutto and sweet, flowery basil very nicely.So, to sum up...Service AQuality of Ingredients AQuantity of Ingredients (prosciutto) A+Quantity of Ingredients (sauce) C+Preparation B- (the first bite of cold prosciutto was a little shocking and the crust was too brittle)Price...Ok, you can look at this one of two ways.  My bill for 2 slices and a lemonade was $13 and change.  I left $17 and called it good so on the one hand, you can say...\"17 bucks for 2 slices of pizza and a lemonade?  That's highway robbery!\"ORYou can say  \"I just ate the amount of quality prosciutto I would get in an appetizer at a good italian restaurant that would have cost at least 12 bucks, plus the pizza. Plus the lemonade, plus a tip.  17 bucks is fair.\"It's all a matter of perspective...And besides, one slice really would have been enough food.  I'm NOT saying I have any feelings of guilt about eating two slices when one would have sufficed...  Excuse me for a moment.(sound of footsteps going down the hall followed by the bathroom door closing)(muffled) \"Fat!  Stupid fatty!  Fat jerk!  I hate you, stupid fatty loser!\"(sound of bathroom door opening and footsteps returning)I'm back!  What was I talking about?  The price!  Right!  I'll rate the price as a BBottom line, will I go back?  Yes, and I'll order one slice and request extra sauce.Overall Rating B\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

On the menu, it lists 3 basic by-the-slice pizzas, but you can ask about others that aren't on the menu. I got one that had bacon on it & some other stuff (but I mean come on, bacon is the most important part anyways)-- but it was so good. The 'special' slices are about a dollar more, but it's worth it. My husband had the Zeus stromboli-- and oh my was it amazing! It was just overflowing with toppings and cheese & the dough was perfect. & their sweet tea is also good here.Love this place. Friendly service, awesome food & decent prices. Lunch specials under $10. Just be warned- it gets packed!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was pleasantly surprised to find the place warm and inviting and the pizza was fantastic. Ties for my favorite outside of NJ    Great crust, excellent sauce/cheese ratio....just everything a pizza should be. Prices were right in line with the average. Would gladly drive 30 minutes to visit again and hope to soon. Interesting that many locals don't like pizza the way I grew up eating it, that is, they have been raised on chain stores like Papa Johns, etc. To me, that stuff isn't edible and belongs in a supermarket freezer. I suggest sitting in for your first visit and just go for a cheese pie. If a pizzeria screws that up, then you know. You won't be disappointed at 5 points.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I guess my overall impression was meh, it's good but not great.  If all you want is to taste garlic, than this is the place to eat.  Sure, we had a plain jane pepperoni pizza, but come on.  The pizza itself-dough, sauce, cheese should be flavorful; unfortunately, this pizza was just boring.Chesters Pizza in Fairfield, OH and Papa Leno's in Berea, KY are my pizza and garlic bread benchmarks.  Sorry Five Points, but you didn't come close to measuring up.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'm not sure why this place has received so many rave reviews. Since we're new to the area and were longing to find a local pizza place we ordered a large, half cheese and half pepperoni pizza from Five Points. We figured that if we liked the basics we could try something more adventurous in the future. The entire pizza can be summed up in one word: bland.The crust was thin and tasted like cardboard. The sauce was bland and there wasn't enough of it. The cheese also had zero flavor and again, there wasn't enough of it either. We were thoroughly disappointed. I love pizza and there have been only 2 occasions in my life when I have been unable to enjoy a pizza and didn't want to eat it. Sadly, Five Points was one of those times. I guess if you're a Nashville native this is your place to go for great pizza but as Nashville newbies we'll keep looking.P.S. if you're ever going to Cleveland, Ohio check out Antonio's Pizza for a great, award winning pizza.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "OK, I'll buck the trend. I've been there probably 4 times, the most recent being today. I have always thought that the best way to judge a pizza joint is by having a plain cheese pizza, so that is what I had today. The pizza was good, but not great. The cheese was dried out on top, so perhaps it needs some greasy pepperoni on it to keep it moist.I appreciate that they have some craft brews, but to me their selection is a bit odd. The Porter has blueberries in it?  Guess I'm old school. The stout today was good, but not great.  Their dark beer choices have always been pretty good, but not great.Anyway, not a bad place at all, but I do wish the crust was softer and the cheese wasnt dry. Perhaps brushing the top of cheese only pizzas with some olive oil? I can see why East Nashvillians would be proud of their local joint, but I am not sure its worth going out of the way for.Update: I went back just a few days later and had another pizza, and it was completely different from the one a few days before. The two pizzas didnt seem to be from the some restaurant, as they were that different. I liked this one more. I asked the server if they serve two types of crusts, and was told there is some variation depending on who cooks. I was told to ask for it to be cooked less if I want the crust to be soft. I appreciated the insight, but would prefer consistency.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "OK. So, I have to admit I have been on a CRAAAZY pizza kick lately. And yes, I'm quite okay with that. In my humble opinion the overall pizza scene over the years in Nashville has been... to say the least, struggling. But, as the dining scene in town continues to heat up, we are thankfully getting more and more fabulous pizza options.Fresh, delicious, and inventive, Five Points Pizza is a MUST try for pizza lovers. They have some of the more inventive combinations I've seen around town, my favorite being the Vodka Sauce Pie. You HAVE to check this out-- it has fresh mozz, house-made vodka tomato cream sauce (amazing), spinach, mushrooms, red onions, prosciutto, garlic, basil, and romano. Absolutely DIVINE.If you don't feel like getting a whole pizza, you can choose from an assortment of slices in addition to some fab salads (my fav is the spinach Gorgonzola). Another item you cannot miss = the Garlic Knots. Seriously, these things are ridiculous.. and in a great way. An awesome beer selection, fun atmosphere, and in the heart of 5 points East Nashville (side note: you probably should go next door to 3 Crow and get a bushwaker for dessert) are a few of the reasons that round out why you should give Five Points Pizza a try. Tip: This is a small place and it fills up quickly on the weekends. Get here early for a table, or order to go!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "On a recent visit to the Nashville area, I started using Google and Yelp to try and locate a place to get a quality meal after an evening at the Grand Ole Opry. Italian food is what I sought.When I proceeded to search, it appears there is some kind of conspiracy under foot, I was caught in the 5  Points Pizza vortex, and parellel universe. I couldn't get out, the reference was always 5  Points.So driving the neighborhood where the 5 pts. references were leading, I found that several bad references were lent to 5 Points and so I avoided being led there.So intervention guided me to PizzeReal.WOW !!!PizzeReal was the most incredible and delicious pizza, kebobs, and Greek salad I have ever had.You could tell the owner Paul gave maximum effort, to not only provide a quality food service, but also an extremely comfortable setting where you could hang out and enjoy this Nashville neighborhood. I will probably never go to 5 Points, because I was extrmely disappointed in how, somehow they try to capture all who seek out pizza in that neighborhood.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This was our first visit an its Great Pizza. I wanted to try something new so i got a Basil Lemonade an we ordered some garlic knots.....which are YUMMY!!!! We just did a pepperoni pizza altho they have several different kinds. We did the 18\" which was 20.00 (not bad for the size).  An its some of the best pizza i have had. Afterwards me an my little girl both got Cannolis' MAN OH MAN ...THEY WERE SOOOO GOOD. Nice an Crisp!! It is hard to find a good cannoli, look no further. The basil lemonade is very different but i really liked it. The service was good except our waiter forgot my brother's beer which my kid decided she would so pleasantly say ...ugh can he get his beer?! ....lol she gets right to the point. He was on his way with our refills an he apologized and had came right back with it. That is really the only complaint i have other than that it was a delightful experience an we will be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Its more of a thin, gooey, cheesy, greasy type of pizza, which is what I like.  If you want some seriously good classic tasting pizza, go here. If you want the fancier, weirder options, go some place else like Mellow Mushroom or Mafiaozas (which are also both very good as well).\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Best pizza in Nashville. Period. I was skeptical about a new pizza place opening in the neighborhood since Pizze Real, Castrillo's and Italia already gave the Eastside good local choices for a delicious slice, but then I came to my senses and realized that your neighborhood can never have too many options for pizza. Let's just say that while those other places can hold their own and make a mean pizza, they are merely the opening act for the spectacular headliner, which is Five Points Pizza. Nestled in the heart of Five Points in East Nashville, this unassuming storefront isn't boastful or trendy, but merges beautifully with the feel of this historic stretch of Woodland. Deceptively small from the outside, the inside of the restaurant stretches back and actually has ample seating in booths, tables, or room to belly up to the bar (great locals on tap-Jackalope, Yazoo, and Calfkiller) if you want to get your cold one a little quicker. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and the decor is a little rustic and well worn, which lends itself well to the age of the neighborhood and feels like it has been a part of it for years. We tried the sliced meatball, the pepperoni, and of course, the garlic knots. First of all, the garlic knots are phenomenal! Nicely toasted and drizzled with olive oil, fresh garlic, parmesan, and fresh basil on the outside, while still tender and fluffy on the inside. Yum...do not pass these up. As we finished our knots, the pizza was brought to the table. As sad as I was to move on from the garlic knots, our gorgeous pizza was there to console me and make it all better. First bite impressions, perfect thickness of crust--foldable, but still crispy without being cracker-like, and still enough breadiness for some chew and structural integrity to your slice. A great balance of fresh sauce, plenty of cheese, and a generous amount of pepperoni and sliced meatballs. The pepperoni was great, but the sliced meatball was AMAHZING! If you are in the mood for a whole pizza or just a quick slice, I would highly recommend Five Points. Friendly staff, reasonable prices, a great beer selection, and awesome pizza. What more could you ask for?\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

There are no mochachinos here nor soy no fat lattes, but they do have some flavors to throw into their iced coffee if you need to change things up.

    "comments": "Hot damn that is some tasty pizza! Five Points Pizza has been open in our hood for a while now, we first noticed them last year at the Tomato Festival slinging slices on the street pre-opening and the line was nuts so we opted not to wait and try it then. I am embarrassed to say we still hadn't stopped to try them in the almost year they have been open since and weren't able to get a table or a slice at Tomato Fest this year either. That is a good sign though! Fortunately I thought of trying a slice or two when we were headed to the Titans vs. Saints preseason game on a Thursday night. We were both pretty hungry and had no plans to eat over-priced stadium food and waste beer money. So, I ran in and ordered a Meatball slice for Elvis and a cheese for myself, added an order of garlic knots too. The Bartender who took my order was very pleasant, the bar was clean and tidy and all of the employees were tending closely to the patrons at tables. The restaurant is MUCH bigger than you would anticipate given the size of the storefront and has a pizza parlor feel with a more modern appeal. The tables are nicely spread out and there are booths in addition to the bar seating, this eased my worries about potentially bringing the kids. Parking however is crap.My order came out quickly and was piping hot! Being that we were heading to the game we had to eat in the car, that I wouldn't recommend but I must say the thinner style crust made it easy to fold the pizza in half ! The sauce was delicious, just enough of it too, greasy enough to be tasty but not so much so that it over powered the taste of the pizza. The crust was perfect for me, thin but not too thin and as I mentioned fold-able. Although his slice had so many meatballs he couldn't fold it as well, but he wasn't complaining and enjoyed the Italian meatballs both for seasoning and size. The garlic knots were a bit of a let down, the fresh basil baked onto them was impressive but wasn't enough to kick up the flavor. Without dipping them in the marinara they couldn't stand on their own taste-wise more like baked dough with some parmesan rather than a true garlic knot. I had hoped to get more garlic flavor, but paired with the sauce they were good enough. Five Points is definitely more expensive than your chain pizza joint - my cheese only slice ran $3.25 or so and his with meat was closer $4.00, the garlic knots are $5 an order (I think that's steep). I am guessing ordering a whole pie would be more economical and compared to slices at the Mall and I suppose it isn't bad considering the quality of the product compared to chains. We will definitely be back to Five Points, I am kicking myself for not trying them sooner!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Born in New York and raised in Philadelphia there are no pizza joints in Nashville that can compare to those two. So I stopped comparing. There is something different about the pizza here that gets lost between the sauce and crust that keeps it from being similar in taste and texture to the pizza in New York and Philadelphia. Nonetheless there are some good pizza spots here in Nashville and five points being one of them. First off I have to warn you that it does get pretty crowded quick during the lunch hours which could set you back 15-20 mins before getting a morsel to eat. For starters garlic knots you can't go wrong with these monstrous twists of pizza dough piping hot and covered with garlic, parmesan cheese, and olive oil. They were delicious I solely recommend getting a full order that's just how scrumptious they were. Our pizza selection consisted of to 14\" pizzas. Because of all the picky eaters that accompanied me I kept it simple and ordered a cheese and a South Brooklyn(my birthplace). The cheese was okay but I really enjoyed the South Brooklyn which had an olive oil base, sauce and basil baked into mozzarella. This was good Nashville style pizza! Prices are reasonable and service was good. Please be mindful of others when you come during lunch hours and not extend your dining experience longer than needed!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I really really liked Five Points Pizza.  Pizza is a tricky thing to me, you see...it's hard to get past \"couldn't I just have made this at home?\", hard to get past \"couldn't I just throw one of those cheapo Tombstone frozen pizzas in the oven?\". So needless to say I don't really go out for pizza. And I've been to soooo many pizza places where the food was just...okay. When I do eat pizza it's usually a spur of the moment plan to satisfy a craving while I'm out and about; our trip to 5 Points Pizza was just that. After we imbibed some freebies at the February Yelp Elite event, my date stated we should go for pizza. I immediately thought it was the best idea ever presented to me and off we went to 5 Points Pizza. We were immediately seated at their 2 person booth. Although  they gave us menus, I ended up deciding in 30 seconds that we were going to order the garlic knots with marinara dipping sauce and a Hawaiian pie to split - I don't even know what other options they have. I could tell the place was busy but the bartender came over and took our orders right away. He was very friendly and laid back and quite frankly made the experience we had enjoyable. Although the place was busy, it wasn't frantic in a negative sort of way. The servers were all upbeat and working their butts off to get orders in and out to tables. Our food came out soon enough and I have to tell you the marinara was 5 stars alone. It is sweet, slightly chunky and very tomatoey without any hint of bitterness. I was so full on garlic knots we ended up taking half our pizza home. I liked the Hawaiian, it comes with pineapples, spicy capocollo and jalapenos. I love when I have left overs, and we had plenty, our server boxed them up for us and even stuck a freshened up marinara tub in there for us!I've heard that since they've opened they have made a lot of changes to their general approach and service, so I can only assume this place will just get better and better. Definitely worth eating here for sure!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This is the best pizza in Nashville. Most recently my wife and I met up with a couple of friends for dinner on a Friday night around 6:00. The restaurant is a little small, and everyone loves it, so there can be a wait on the weekends. We had a 30 minute wait for a table in this case, which we spent at the bar. The bar is in the back with a selection of beer and wine.  It is a small bar with a small-town feel to it. It always seems like people are running into someone they know, and the bartenders seem to know a lot of the patrons who stop in for a drink or a slice. Their beer selection is perfect for a pizza place: 10 taps with an emphasis on local breweries, one of which is reserved for a high gravity selection. On this occasion, they had good people IPA on tap (a fantastic IPA out of Birmingham, AL with a smash of grapefruit and a crisp dry finish. It has become my go-to IPA since moving down south), so we were perfectly content grabbing a seat at the bar and waiting for our table.Once we were seated, we got an order of garlic knots, which are delicious (and have a ton of garlic) and $3 gets you an order of four. We ordered an 18\" Zeus, which is our favorite pizza on the menu. Peporoni, spicy capicola, banana peppers, black olives, and feta cheese. Its got a little bit of kick to it with a touch of sweet, kind of like a good italian sub, and the black olives and feta give it a sort of greek salad finish. It also re-heats really well, so we always get the 18\" whenever we go to ensure we will have plenty of leftovers! Our two friends ordered a build-your-own pie with pepperoni and jalapeno. The fresh jalapenos had some serious kick. The service was outstanding as always: attentive, kept an eye on our drinks, and patient with us when we kept forgetting to decide on our order. I will say the pizza is a little bit on the pricey side, and seating can feel a little bit cramped, especially in the tables by the doors. But once you have their pizza you will struggle to justify getting a pie anywhere else in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The garlic knots are also superb.On the negative side, we have the typical East Nasty drawbacks: parking, small interior, out of the way (for me at least).  There was a large group that had pushed almost every table together in the middle of the restaurant, and according to a server they had been there for hours.  Our wait would have been much, much shorter were it not for them, but Five Points made up for it and then some with a free plate of garlic knots while we waited at the bar!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

On the other hand, I was so excited when I saw those knots come out so much bigger then I expected. If its just 2 of you then a half order will be fine! I think there were 4 or 5 of them and they are large. They were amazeballs. The service was perfect too.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

He invited me on a \"date\" for dinner there one night, and there I found out he'd already been there that same day for lunch!Great pizza, fresh ingredients, great service (even when something goes wrong), and the best garlic knots around. My favorite is the Dave's slice with prosciutto, fresh basil and parmigiano reggiano cheese. The crust is always delicious and the beer there is good too. Their spinach salad is a nice light choice if you're not in the mood for a slice. With dried cranberries, red onions and blue cheese crumbles--try the viniagrette dressing, it goes great.We always feel at home here, whether for lunch or dinner. It does great crowded on weekend nights, so if you have a larger group or family, going earlier is better. I do love how many different types of customers there are there. Singles, couples, hipsters, families, everyday Joes -- all are welcome here.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

After adding my dressing, the tiny bowl to bountiful salad ratio leaves zero room for mixing, tossing, what have you.As the previous Yelper noted, a pizza slice is served on a paper plate.  I don't know why, and until reading that review I hadn't really given it any thought.  I am so ashamed.  I am an East Nashvillian, I have my own reusable grocery bags, I downgraded to a more fuel-efficient car, and apparently my oversight regarding the paper plate conspiracy has put me out of line with my community's values.  Honestly, I don't know what is up with the paper plates.  True, it doesn't fit with with anything else in the restaurant, but it's a new business.  Perhaps reusable plates are on the horizon when they reach some business goal.  I think their food is delicious, but as a new business, there are a couple of details they could probably use our input on.  Bigger salad bowls, ceramic plates to match those awesome salad bowls.  Maybe a special salad or app every so often.  If we all love one of them enough it could be in the running for a new menu item??\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "One day during a recent trip to Nashville, Mr. Babypants passed out in his seat and lunch had to be had in the car. Fast food drive through is the easiest (laziest?) option in this instance but there was no way in hell I was going to waste a vacation meal on a chain. Luckily we were close by Five Points, a small commercial district that splinters off of Gallatin Pike in East Nashville, so I popped into Five Points Pizza and ordered slices. I didn't take in much of the interior design other than it fits into that increasingly common contemporary-and-sleek-but-a-little-bit-rustic-and-industrial milieu. All I remember is that I immediately felt like I made the right decision.I bypassed the greeter and went straight to the bar to order carryout. The bartender was friendly and easygoing, quickly and pleasantly explaining how Five Points does what it does to this first-time customer. Prosciutto and basil and straight pepperoni slices were the most appealing on that day's lineup and 10 minutes later they were ready. The New York-style crust was cracker crisp on the bottom, breaking into odd-shaped shards when folded in half. Each slice was perfectly composed, filling without being heavy. A+, would do business again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni, late night. Both were quite tasty. All this said, it's too expensive - $3.25 for a slice of cheese, $3.75 for a slice of pepperoni, $16 is the base to start building an 18\" pizza; there's just no reason for that in Nashville.

Its in 5 points, parking can be a challenge and prime dinner times, especially the weekends are slamming. For take out, it's usually a 30 - 45 minute wait but the pizza is good. For in service dining, I recommend going early. Cool music, nice friendly servers, and interesting slices of the day. I had a pepperoni, mushroom and some other meat that was great. My favorite are the garlic knots. If you like garlic, oil, basil and cheese this is your dish. We always get it.  I would rather eat garlic knots then pizza most days.  They have a good selection of local beers on tap. Dave's pizza was our favorite slice we got. Dave has got it right.  I would say to me its a little bit expensive for a whole pizza $22 for a large that could feed atleast 4 people. However, I think about the $5 HOT N you know what's ready to come out you back side type pizza and it that spectrum ... yes, its worth it. A slice will run you $3-$5 but is filling.

At first I thought she was just a Jersey/NY pizza elitist with a penchant for extra grease on her pie, but after trying it myself I agree! This is the healthiest seeming 'NY Style' pizza, well...ever? I guess I can paint a picture by explaining that I only used ONE NAPKIN the entire time I was there.All that aside, the marinara was delish and the fresh basil on my garlic knots was the meow. They have a rotating French Broad on tap along with some local and domestic selections. I think it'd be my new favorite joint should the pizza be $2 cheaper (18 inch veggie is $22) and the beer about .50 cents cheaper (draft runs $5 for a microbrew, which isn't too too bad) - but maybe the 5 points address runs steep? Husband and I showed up around 6:30 and were seated right away with a friendly smile and beer & garlic knots soon thereafter. About 30 minutes later was a different story as it started to get pretty packed. I recommend eating early!The place was full of families, but as a non-breeder myself, all of them were staggeringly well-behaved and I didn't mind it at all! I'm sure the scene changes a little as the night wears on - open til 11pm or midnight every night. Nice!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Five Points Pizza is a pretty decent pizza joint all things considered.  I dug the pizza, thought the crispy crust was spot on and had a pretty good time.  Me and the boy split a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni and I had a house salad.  It was all good and I imagine we will be back soon for more.  That being said, the prices are on the steep end.  3.25 for a cheese slice and 4.75 for draft beer is pretty steep in this town.  The quality is there, but I have a hard time justifying $10+ per person for pizza with so many good options in town.  I consider this a temporary review until I have had a few more exposures.  The place was packed on a Friday night so I imagine they will be around a bit longer to test out. If nothing else Five Points Pizza is worth a shot if you are on the east side and want a sit down pizza experience.  Recommended with few reservations\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Now, married to a pizzaholic, I eat my fair share of pizza, and I have to say that Five Points Pizza is the best pizza joint in Nashville right now -- and that's a big honor coming from me, who usually doesn't like it if a pizza place doesn't offer a pasta counterpart.I am a fan of New York-style pizza, and this is the closest thing we've got here in Music City. Being able to be seated immediately the handful of times I've been is a huge point (ahem, Mafiaoza's), and offering up pizza by the slice for those of us who are pretty much done after one or two pieces -- yes, please. Especially when you are also serving up cheap $5 garlic knots, basically greasy, carb-y, delicious hunks of bread to dunk in a sweet-salty marinara sauce. (And I do judge my pizza joints based on the sauce -- RIP, Da Vinci's.)  The pizza itself is big slices, on crust that's the perfect balance between thick and thin, served on paper plates, the kind you have to fold in half to eat. I usually get it by the slice -- once we got a whole pie, and the topping options are much better, but it gets a little pricey. The beer isn't cheap either, but they do have a good selection.Go after 10 on a weeknight (not sure about happy hour on weekends) to get $5 for a slice and a beer. That's a better deal than you get from most food trucks around here.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "It's generally unfair to judge a place that just recently opened as most need time to work the kinks out.  But my first experience at Five Points Pizza is Five Star worthy!  The location is fabulous, and they are open until the early morning hours on Fridays and Saturdays which I think is very smart to get the late night munchies crowd.  The interior is cute and clean (well I should hope so after being open only two weeks) with booths, tables, and a bar.  Service for lunch was fast and friendly.  We both had house salads, which were pretty large, filling, and fresh.  I had a slice of cheese and a slice of the special, which was prosciutto, fresh basil, and pecorino romano.  Both were delicious!! There are numerous whole pie options including vegetarian, Greek, Old World, and build your own.  There's an appetizer called Garlic Knots which we didn't try but sounds heavenly, and four different salad options.  There is also draft and bottled beer (yay!).  Excellent addition to Five Points and I will be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This Pizza rocks. I ordered a slice while I waited for the pie to take out and loved it. I then took the pie home and my wife and mother in law loved it. I've had pizza in New York and pizza in Italy and I can say that 5 pts got it just right. Thinner crust, slightly crispy without too much sauce. We ordered the Supreme and will be ordering it again tonight. Also had a house salad which was delicious. Seems like a pleasant atmosphere to eat in. If you want to enjoy the crispyness then sit down and eat there. If you want it to soften up a little, take it home. Thanks for delivering a much needed answer for quality pizza in East Nashville.

Then I write a review that 5 Points Pizza is too healthy. I still stand by my review HOWEVER their healthy stromboli was a welcome option to what I'm battling down here.

We ordered the vegetarian pizza and they loaded up the toppings! I don't think I've ever seen so many on a pie. I didn't get a beer, although I was eying their menu and  they have a nice selection on tap. Tip: You're probably better off ordering a whole pizza (there are two sizes). I dare you to eat one slice and not any more, which makes more sense and saves you some money. I can't wait to go back and try their garlic knots! Oh boy.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "It seems like yesterday that we moved to Nashville, and there were hardly any local pizza places in the core area. There was DaVinci's and Pizza Perfect and that was it. Now there is an overwhelming selection, and while Five Points Pizza is a little late to the party, they've made a fashionable entrance into the scene. We have a baby, so we wanted to come at a time when it wouldn't be difficult to find a seat and we wouldn't have to barge through with our baby carrier. That proved difficult, because this place is really popular. Here's how it works. There's a menu with a few appetizers and salads. There are three everyday options for pizza-by-the-slice: cheese, pepperoni, and what's called \"Dave's Pie\"--it has prosciutto and basil and some other toppings. Then there are \"special slices.\"  I had a slice of meatball pizza and a slice of cheese. I also opted for a Yazoo Gerst on draft.The beer was the coldest I've ever had at any restaurant. That was definitely a good start. We didn't get any appetizers, but the pizza came in about ten minutes. Here's what you need to know about the pizza:-it's not greasy at all-the ingredients are very high-quality-you can tell that the crust and sauce are well thought-out. -the crust isn't floppy, it's thin and firm, but not dry and crumbly. It's not stereotypical \"new york style,\" but it gets the best features of the style correct.Some people are really picky about their pizza, so FPP can't please everyone. But it pleased me! We'll definitely be regulars, albeit at off-peak hours.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'm not a pizza snob at all - I enjoy all kinds - I just want it to be GOOD. And damn, this was unexpectedly f'ing delicious. I had a slice of the meatball (with fresh & shredded mozz., red onion and thinly-sliced meatball) and the flavors were absolutely great. It was also nice to have a crust that was crisply from the center to the crust. But again, the flavor...so good! Quite possibly the best pizza I've ever eaten. And the garlic knots w/ fresh basil were pretty damn good, too.Maybe the reviewers that complain about this not being authentic NY pizza or \"not greasy enough\" need to just try it without any thoughts of what it should be. Pretend it's not pizza, it's just dinner. Great food is great food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Love the interior of the space. Great roomy booths. Really cool place.The Menu: pretty basic. I'd like to see an expansion with more offerings in the salad category and some other apps. We got the garlic knots and they were pretty yummy, if not a bit coated in oil.The Pizzas: good offerings-- nothing with chicken really, and pretty much just more of the classic varieties. The crust is very chewy and yummy.  The sauce leaves something to be desired, the hubs + me weren't really into it, but other diners seemed to like it.The Beer: a decent basic selection. I'm sure that will also be expanded in time.The Prices: The prices seemed a little high. The Verdict: I'll wait 6 months and try it again and revise my review if it needs it.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was visiting Nashville from Boston and got pizza from Five Points after seeing so many positive reviews. After eating 2 slices of pepper and mushroom pizza, I was mystified - the pizza was not good and neither were the garlic knots. The place was packed and the atmosphere was cool, but the sauce was flat - no tanginess - and the cheese didn't seem to have flavor either. The garlic knots were big and doughy, but also lacked flavor. The dude who sold me the pizza was really nice, but the pizza was worse than any local pizza I've had in Boston or NY. If this is the best local pizza Nashville has to offer, I'll have to go for Dominoes next time I'm in town, especially since I paid 30 bucks for food that my girlfriend and I agreed was surprisingly bad.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This pizza was amazing! I love pizza, but I'm a tough judge when it comes to \"real\" pizza, and this is real pizza. My husband and I were visiting family in Nashville when we stopped in for some lunch. The six of us shared an ordered of Garlic knots, they were so delicious. The marinara sauce on the side was the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Then my husband and I ordered one slice of meatball pizza (the special) and a slice of Dave's. The meatball was topped with fresh and shredded mozzarella, meatballs, red onions, garlic, pecorino Romano and Dave's is Prosciutto, fresh basil, pecorino Romano. Dave's was really really good, but the meatball was probably the best slice of pizza I've ever had. I looked around and most people had either ordered a slice of meatball or Dave's but I also saw alot of people with really great looking salads. They have a fantastic beer selection; bottled and draft (the prices were just ok though). The staff was so talkative and helpful and the service was very quick. There is alot of seating for parties of all sizes and it seems to have a great reputation already for being a newly opened business. I could've eaten at Five Points Pizza everyday...if you are in the neighborhood you need to stop in and try a slice!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I walked into Five Points Pizza tonight and after all was said and done, it was not what I expected. As a resident of East Nashville, I am always pleased to see new businesses pop up. My girlfriend and I had been planning on eating there since we heard about the place opening. When i walked up to the front door, I saw a half-full restaurant with a group of six waiting to be seated. I tried to open the door, but the people wouldn't move to let me inside. This was not because they were inconsiderate, but because there was no room for them to move. No waiting area and barely enough room for those six people to stand comfortably. After I was seated, we looked over the menu and i was disappointed to see that there was only one item listed as an appetizer- the garlic knots. We decided against them and went straight for the salad and slices. I have to say, there could have been more salad choices. There were two salads. We each ordered the same thing- a house salad and a slice of pepperoni pizza. The salads came quickly and consisted of lettuce, mushrooms, and grape tomatoes which were topped with grated mozzarella cheese and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing ($5 each). they tasted about how they looked and were the size of side salads, but left something more to be desired. Shortly after finishing the salads our pizza slices arrived. The server set them down on the table and i noticed that they were on PAPER PLATES! I was confused- the salads came in ceramic bowls and the appetizers on other guests tables were on ceramic dishes. Why was pizza the only thing on the menu that comes on a paper plate? I'm not sure if their dishwasher was broken or if they were trying to save on the water bill or whatever, but definitely was not fitting in with the \"green\" East Nashville vibe. I am a firm believer that any indoor restaurant that has a host seat patrons should not serve food on paper plates. The pizza was average. I figured I couldn't really go wrong with just ordering a regular slice of pizza, but i wish I would have gone somewhere else that would serve me food on an actual dish.... maybe Chuck E Cheese?Unfortunately i was unable to get over the paper plate ordeal for the rest of my visit. I don't understand the rave reviews that i keep hearing, but i am willing to give it another try. I don't see how this place fits into the East Nashville scene at all. They are not eco-friendly and don't seem to have many vegetarian options and clearly no vegan options. PROs- good lighting, warm atmosphere, nice staff.CONs- no waiting area, cramped entryway, not enough appetizers, limited salad options, PAPER PLATES, not inline with community values/objectives, too pricey for generic pizza.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'll try and be brief and to the point. My wife and I and one of our daughters visited for the first time last night. We thought we'd keep it simple. We ordered salads which were fresh and plentiful. As for pizza, our daughter ordered a slice of cheese and we ordered an 18\" Old World. Pretty simple. What we got seemed more like the idea of a pizza. The pizza itself was lighter than air, not a good sign and the crust was stiff and dry. I want that slice to droop! I want to have to fold that crust in my hand. I concur with some of the other reviewers. Gimme some grease! Give me my guilty pleasure! If this pizza hadn't been cut into slices I could have used it for a frizbee. The toppings were barely there. Yes I know , the Old World is basically a Margerita pizza with just mozzarella, tomatoes and/or sucace and basil. In this case there were NO tomato slices as the menu advertised. Just little splotches of sauce, which was tasty but few and far between, along with razor thin slices of mozz along and basil. Again, it just seemed like the idea of a pizza. Call it 'essence of pizza'. Sorry to report but, our daughter's slice of cheese pizza wasn't much better. We're no pizza snobs but, we know a lame pizza when we try one. I never write reviews like this so that ought to tell you something.So, for three salads, one 18\" pizza and three sodas we paid, with tip $61.00. Coulda gone to Pizza Perfect, paid about half the price and gotten the real deal.We are totally glad Five Points Pizza has arrived. But, with what we got and what had to pay, I have to say it'll probably will be a while before we return. Make a REAL pizza and we'll run back and keep our money in the neighborhood.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I attended a soft opening last week and I can't wait to go back! The owners are super friendly, the atmosphere is casual, modern, and relaxing. They have a great beer selection and every dish we tried was amazing! We started out with the warm, garlic knots, then a caprese salad, then 2 different pizzas, THEN canoles!! Yes, we were stuffed! The Old World pizza was the table fave. It has fresh mozzorella and fresh basil. The crust is just the right amount of crunchy and soft.

    "comments": "Another NEW pizza place in Nashville, and this one in East Nashville...woohoo!. After Months of waiting, Five Points Pizza is FINALLY open. Day of I called to order a pie...wah wah... no take out. Bummer.        The reason for no take out is apparently to give them time to get their system down and they want to give dine in customers the best experience they possibly can. I can appreciate the care they want to give their customers. Hopefully Take Out will be available soon.          I decided to try a slice of cheese yesterday for lunch. I figured if they are really focusing on giving good service, pizza etc, that it probably won't get any better than this, right?          I ordered the slice, which was $3.25 and not that big for a NY slice (a cheese slice at Manny's is $2.35). I grabbed the bag, got in my car and headed home. I was very excited after reading numerous reviews of the best pizza in Tennessee etc. I think my expectations were a bit too high. I really loved the crust. I thought it was a perfect thickness, the bottom had a crunch, while the  end crust still had some chew. The flavor , however, was decent but hardly the best in town. It reminded me an awful lot of Sbarro in taste.           I feel that East Nashville finally has a decent tasting pizza. To me Five Points Pizza is a much better option than, Roma, Pizzareal, Castrillo's, Italia or any of the other pizza offerings in East Nashville. For New York style Pie,  however, there is much better pizza in town.  Manny's House of Pizza is still the king located right over the bridge from east nashville in the arcade..ALWAYS consistent, always great. A close second to Manny's is NY Pie, a great new pizza joint located in Nashville West. Knead Dough Pizzeria in Hendersonville is probably above Five Points in flavor, however, Five Points definitely has them beat on crust. Five Points Pizza is also a more expensive option than any of it's better tasting competitors.            It will be interesting to see how consistent Five Points Pizza continues to be. To me this is the determining factor to a great pizza joint. I want to know that every pizza I get from a pizzeria will taste exactly the same. This is one reason why Manny's is still king. He has a great pizza and an amazingly consistent pizza (partly due to the fact that Manny makes all his pizzas).. my experience with NY Pie has also been pretty consistent.              Once Five Points offers carry out I am sure they will do a lot more business. One truly great thing about FPP is their hours... they are open til midnight most nights of the week and open til 2 am on Friday and Saturday. So when all your favorite pizza joints are closed but your still hankerin for some pizza... you can call FFP and get some pretty decent foldable pie.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My experience was great, even if I did pay more. My order was quickly completed and I found the pie quite enjoyable. The hand tossed crust was crisp and chewy where it should be with plenty of flavor without being soaked in grease. Toppings were quality and generous. It floored me that it was less than $10 for a large. If you're in the city and want to carry out, stop by and cruise their extensive menu. If the rest is as good as their pizza, this place deserves more attention than they are getting!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Honestly, my only negative is that it is a little more expensive than I typically want to pay for dinner.  But it is so good that I will be back!

The first thing we noticed was the amazing smell- wafts of garlic and bread filled the space. If the food was as good as the smell, we were in for a treat.  The beer selection was good, with a mix of draft and bottles.We originally ordered the Antipasto Platter as an appetizer, but they had run out of many of the ingredients due to the high volume of the first week (a good problem to have).  We chose the Garlic Knots instead and they did not disappoint. Hot, buttery and flecked with lots of fresh garlic. The real star here though was (as it should be) the pizza! Dave's Pie was the perfect mix of Salty Prosciutto, gooey cheese, tangy tomato sauce, and finished with a some fresh basil.  The crust is perfect- thin, but not to thin, slightly crunchy, yet chewy. Service was good, and the waitstaff was all friendly and attentive.  We will be back soon, and we will be back often. You should join us- you can thank me later!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Dave's (proscuitto, basil and cheese), meatball, and pepperoni.  The service has always been adequate and the food is good  Tonight, we decided to have a 14 inch pie because our server, Kate, was actually great in making suggestions and expounding on things.  All the other servers usually just take your order and then bring your stuff (which is ok too).  But Kate was engaging and made our experience fun.  I am a server and I guess i forget how much a great personality can affect your overall experience.  Anyways,  I recommend you ask for Kate (unless you're a lousy ass tipper) and i also recommend you get a 14 inch pie.  It's a much better deal and I have leftover for the morning.  The pie we ate had pepperoni, banana peppers, feta, mozzarella, and capicola or some type of salami.  It was DEELISH... we went to Jeni's for ice cream afterwards which is awesome!!!  I didn't hit a home run, but i did make it to third base.  My date was cute too. Thanks Kate for helping break the ice.I'm making this suggestion to you guys... we did NOT like paper plates.  We're not asking for a set of gold limoge...  but, even if you were passing out those cheap ass plastic plates they use in cafeterias... we would have been happier and it would have been better suited to your place.  In the long run... it will cost you more to use paper plates because you will have to continue to buy them over and over.  This is EAST Nashville too... people are freaky about recycling, but in all seriousness... it's more eco friendly NOT to use disposable.  You guys are the best pizza place in East Nashville and second to only City House in the entire city.  Get some plates!  you're going to be around for a while.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I gave it some time and a few visits before I decided to review, as reviewing a brand new restaurant isn't really fair to them. I've dined in and carried out several times, each being a pleasurable experience. I did once order a white pie that came out overcooked. Before it even arrived I was notified by our waitress that the pie was overcooked and they would be glad to cook me another one. Being understanding and supportive of locally owned eateries I didn't get angry at the mishap and declined the new pie. 10 minutes later I have a properly cooked pizza in front of me anyway. That's service. I carry out a couple of times a month too, and Allison is always bright and cheery when getting my order ready, or serving me a pre-takout beer. She's obviously providing great service as I never remember anyone's name. Ever. Especially with pizza on my mind. How's the pizza? Great. The marinara is outstanding. Tangy, fresh, chunky, just a hint of sweetness. Possibly my favorite marinara around. The ingredients always seem fresh and high quality. The crust is great, but in my own personal taste I think it could be a little more moist. To each their own however. Also, don't go across the street to the other pizza spot on the block. I won't support anyone who complains about food trucks and runs them out of the area. The pizza made at non-dick managed places tastes better anyway.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "TL;DR: Tons of terrific vegetarian options that range from vegetarian versions of meat dishes (using seitan or creatively substituting vegetables) to classic veggie options (think bean soups, stews, bowls). Reasonable prices, but tends to be hard to find parking during busy times. Being a Southern city, Nashville really doesn't have that many vegetarian spots, so I've decided to go on a tour of all of them and figure out which ones are best. First stop was at the Wild Cow after picking up my 11 year old brother from his first day of school down the street.Food: My brother got the veggie burger with chips and salsa as his side, while I had the lentil bowl with garlicky kale (+$1.5) and quinoa (unbeknownst to me, +$1). Everything on the menu was around $10; I peeked around and all the portions seemed pretty big.My brother loved his veggie burger - which he put BBQ sauce on, sigh - but the chips and salsa, which we shared, were just standard. Excellent blue corn chips but salsa was a little watery. My lentil stew was delicious - probably from the incredibly creamy, garlicky aioli. Yum. There's an option to add garlic aioli to a bunch of the other dishes, and I would highly recommend doing that. Garlicky kale and quinoa added some texture, but I would have loved a little extra carrot.Price: Paid about $28 total for the two of us plus tax and tip. Atmosphere: We went around noon and it was packed. However, we only had about a 5 min wait before we were seated, and we waited about 10 mins for food to come out. It's a tiny, cute restaurant space with a bunch of two-person tables. Mostly young professionals dining, though I saw a few other middle school kids like my brother.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I shared the buffalo tempeh sandwich, Philly cheesesteak, mashed sweet potatoes, and kale. I had some amazing buffalo tempeh at Champ's Diner in Brooklyn, which probably isn't a fair comparison, but something was missing here. I wanted more flavor, more spice, or both. The philly was yummy but I usually don't like fake cheese and this was no exception. I would definitely order it again without the cheese to give it another go. The sweet potatoes also just okay. Luckily the kale was great and the raspberry iced tea with agave was so good that I asked for a to go cup. Overall, my experience was meh but I want to go back and try some other dishes.TL;DR: Cute place. Great service. Meh food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We arrived at 3 PM on a Saturday for a late lunch and were told there was a 45 minute wait. Even after we were seated, people were still pouring in. Awesome selection of exotic herbal infusion hot teas. They seem pricy at first, but you get a big mug and the infusions are strong enough for a hot water top off. Not all dishes are vegan, some are served with cheese/dairy. Gluten-free options are available and plenty.My tempeh tacos were the bombdiggity. I loved the peanut dressing. I'd  buy a bottle or the recipe if they offered it. Very filling and 100% crave worthy. The BF loved his veggie melt sandwich. There were so many great menu options, it was truly hard to choose.

The Wild Cow is really cute, but I found our service to be a bit lacking. Our waitress seemed uninterested in making sure we were taken care of.My sister had raved about the Pistachio & Pear salad so we ordered that to split in addition to the Veggie Burger with cheese. My sister also got a kombucha, which the waitress kind of just awkwardly plopped down in front of us. The food was just ok. I'm used to the best of the West coast veggie spots, and The Wild Cow probably wouldn't stay in business long out here unless they tweaked their recipes a bit. There really wasn't much spice or taste to the food. It needed more excitement in the flavor and it was all very bland. Maybe the chef was having an off day, or we ordered the wrong things.

We ended the meal with this chocolate marzipan cake that was surprising rich and NOT dry or too moist! The consistency was perfect! The staff is very friendly and helpful when deciding what to order, they are honest about what is GOOOOD on the menu and recommend some great choices!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Tennessee is not my state of choice for brandishing any awards for veg restaurants. However, this lovely lil Wild Cow eatery made me think twice about writing off Nashville from possible veg- friendly cities.  It is good. It is really good. Provided, of course, that you like fresh, made to order, veg home cooked, flavorful, American style comfort food.Who doesn't?! Nachos taller than your eyes can stomach? Yes please. Cupcakes made in house and from Vegan Vee for the gluten free- thank yee, Wild Cow. How now? Raw desserts from Rawr like chia pudding and cheese cake? In which one should I not partake?Tacos tacos tacos- can't decide. Make my decision- taco trio sampler. Done. Best vegan taco trio I have had, ever. Makes Texas look further. Vegan tacos are usually meat analogues or some other phoney baloney posing as a meal... Vegans will accept the offering, tail between legs, happy for some taco tastes that don't torture tastebuds... But here, it's a party. Great variety- sweet potato and black bean, tempeh and avocado, chipotle black bean. Oh so good.Not your style? Delicious and filling bowls of grains and veggies at fair prices that won't bust your wallet but will make for an explosive mouth sensation of delightful seasoning and fresh veg ingredients. Seriously worth it!Ok, I could go on about the food.The bad? It's small, really small. Expect to wait. They reserve part of the bar area near the desserts, kitchen and register for staff breaks, so it's deceiving. Order to go? Parking can be tough on this neighborhood like commercial area. Worth it. All worth it.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I also went with the taco sampler platter, which was awesome. I'm big on authentic Mexican food so I NEVER order tacos in a non-Mexican restaurant but these, though not traditional, were made with really interesting ingredients and had great flavor combinations (sweet potatoes, pumpkin seeds, jerk seasoning, etc). Nice job! I also love that they had so many sides to chose from beyond the usual fries or salad. I went with a Thai carrot soup (yum!) and sauteed kale (not spectacular, but got my greens in!)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The Sweet potato and Peanut Tempeh tacos were pretty good but the Chipotle Seitan Taco was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I will not be trying anything else on the menu next time I go because that Taco was one of the best things I have eaten in Nashville.If you are hesitant about going to this place because they don't serve meat do not worry. The tacos are just as good if not better than most other places in town.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It is always busy so unfortunately, I do not have any tips regarding the perfect time to visit. There is usually a wait since the restaurant is so small and the food is so delicious!The menu is extensive. Usually vegetarian restaurants I have visited in the past do not offer so many menu items, but The Wild Cow disproves the concept that a vegetarian diet does not offer variety. The prices are great! The service is excellent. It is an all around East Nashville staple. It is right next door to Jeni's ice cream. Therefore, if the desserts that The Wild Cow offers doesn't tickle your taste bud fancy, then take a 40 step stroll next door to Jeni's ice cream.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Wild Cow is a fantastic restaurant. I myself am not a vegan/vegetarian, but I lean towards and crave foods of that nature more so than meat and most animal products. Living in Nashville, TN where there is a plethora of; fast food, Southern, Hot Chicken and BBQ restaurants on every block, it's frustrating that there aren't more restaurants like this. I would suggest a second or THIRD location within the Nashville area!? Maybe near the West End?My favorite item to order here is their version of a Rueben! They serve it with your choice of either tofu or seitan as a protein substitute on Rye bread and an option of Swiss Cheese or VEGAN Mozzarella! I've found the combination of tofu and vegan mozzarella on the Rueben to be quite delicious! I choose to eat it with a side of Seitan drizzled with VEGAN BBQ sauce which makes for a healthy and hearty meal! I'm not kidding you when I say that their Rueben is almost 95% similar in taste to a corned beef Rueben. Just imagine eating a Rueben without the grease and fat!! That's what their sandwich tastes like. One time I brought my fiancée and she ordered their Vegan \"Beef\" Au Ju sandwich served with a vegetable broth \"Au Ju\" substitute. She herself is not as open to vegan/vegetarian fare and was only able to eat half the sandwich. I asked for a doggy bag and ate the other half the next afternoon! Quite delicious! The restaurant staff are very nice and eclectic in personalities and so are their clientele. I also love the T-shirts for sale including one that reads \"Hail Seitan\" (not the devil, but the protein substitute). It's hilarious and I would buy it, but since we're in The Bible Belt, I don't see myself buying it any time soon.As a person who lives an Omnivorous lifestyle, I would suggest this restaurant to anyone who is a meat eater but is willing to try foods that are 100% healthy and anyone willing to try something new! I'm sure 100% vegans and vegetarians already know how epic this place is.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

With that said, Wild Cow is easily one of the best vegetarian restaurants I've been to yet. Unlike some vegetarian restaurants that use pre-made substitutes, everything here is made from scratch. Everything from the beer, to the appetizers,to the entrees was delicious. We ordered the vegan nachos for an appetizer, and they were some of the best nachos I've ever had. They were made with homemade cheese sauce and sour cream, and had tons of bean and veggie toppings. For an entree I went with the taco trio, so that I could try a variety of their dishes in one meal. It included a peanut tempeh, chipotle seitan, and sweet potato tacos. The tacos were delicious, especially the chipotle seitan!

I ended up with a Lentil bowl with some garlicky kale and brown rice. The kale was sauteed nicely with plenty garlic and complemented the soft lentil and vegetable that were poured ontop. Their brown rice added a soft but slightly crunchy texture to the vegetables. My friends both had sandwiches with corn totilla chips and hummus.

    "comments": "Even after traveling extensively, The Wild Cow remains one of my favorite places in the country to eat awesome vegan food. Everything is fresh, menu modifications can be made, and the service is timely and friendly. The humble space, decorated with warm wood excellent images of cows in hyper-perspective, is fun, funky, and feels spacious even when the restaurant is totally full. Having eaten here many times over the course of 5 years, I have developed a go-to custom order: vegan nachos with fajita + seitan and avocado, over brown rice. The nachos in general are a great shared appetizer if you're in a group!Other favorite, less complicated orders: Far Eastland bowl, peanut tempeh tacos, buffalo beans & greens bowl, \"the philly\"Note: there is almost always a wait here for dinner, especially on Friday. No reservations, so come early or come late if you want to avoid waiting.Another note: vegan cupcakes here are awesome when they have 'em! Fridge has some packaged raw vegan treats and kombucha\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I can't say it's fantastic and I really wanted to love it, but I just wasn't blown away by everything even though it's all veg and I go nuts for that (bc I'm one duh!) I had the peanut tempeh tacos which were delightful! And the boy had the Philly which I didn't like at all, but he thought was pretty good. The coconut soup was cold and sweet and not my favorite, but it was a definitely a good palate cleanser. Our waitress was really sweet even though the check seemed a little funky, but the waiter who gave us water and then transferred to other tables seemed a bit strange. Service and food were quick and it's a small place, so don't be surprised if they kick you out for sitting too long (happened to the table next to us even though they got food just before we ordered ours).\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The one with a peanut sauce stood out to me, but that one ended up being not as flavorful or exciting as the other too. The seitan taco was so good, and I think you could fool anyone with this meat substitute. The sweet potato taco was just as delicious. For a side I had the \"garlicky kale\" - WOW. Get it.

I've been wanting to try this place out forever, but some of my carnivore friends politely declined. The flavors are so spot on, I honestly didn't even realize that meat wasn't there. I went on a Wednesday. So Wednesday's they have $1 off all alcoholic beverages. I had the castle rock Pinot noir. It was delicious, but I'm definitely a Pinot girl. I believe Monday's they also have a special $10 for a veggie burger and a beer. For food: I kept going back and forth between the sampler taco plate and the far eastland bowl, but as much as I love tacos... I love Asian inspired more. This bowl had brown rice, pickled daikon and carrots commonly found in Vietnamese dishes (sold!), tofu, kale, etc. weirdly, I generally am not a kale fan, I've tried it prepared several ways. So I'm unsure what they did, but however it was prepared... it left me wanting more. My friend said the tacos were awesome as well. She loved all three. The server said the seitan was his favorite. I'll maybe have to try it next time if I can stray away from the far eastland bowl. Or I could be happy with both. Regardless, I definitely want to come back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "When I think Nashville, I think southern fried cooking and BBQ. To my surprise and due to my awesome friend Janelle's research, we came across the vegan/vegetarian delight that is The Wild Cow.Located in a very nice neighborhood, with a few other shops, this place is a refreshing change to a meat eaters daily diet (I was a vegetarian for 13 years , but eventually converted back). Now the place itself isn't that big and it seems like it's very popular, but the wait wasn't bad at all. We just killed some time at the counter ordering a beer and talking.Upon being seated, we were greeted by our awesome server. Seeing we were starving we were ready to order. For the appetizer we had the Buffalo Tempeh Strips, served with carrots, celery, and ranch(which is vegan ranch and I promise you, you can't tell the difference). It was delicious! The tempeh wasn't dry and the buffalo sauce was delicious! Needless to say, that was inhaled in a matter of seconds. For my entree I was torn by pretty much everything, since it all looked so good, but I went with the Roasted Portobello Burger. It comes with a sage portobello mushroom cap, spinach, cashew Gouda, red peppers, sprouts, onions and tahini sauce, which really makes the flavors all blend deliciously. I added Swiss to it, of course and for a side had the spinach and artichoke dip. For dessert we had this amazing vegan chocolate cake. Now obviously it's not going to taste exactly like a regular cake, but personally I enjoyed it. The cake had the consistency of a cake pop, where the batter is really almost doughy and moist. The frosting was also heavenly, actually all of the cupcakes, cookies and cakes looked delicious. This meal made me reconsider going back to being a vegetarian. The Wild Cow will make a vegetarian out of you yet! Just you wait!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The first time I could not resist the Far Eastland Bowl; it did not disappoint. That peanut sauce...omg. I really had dreams about that bowl for a few days after and even tried to recreate at home (didn't touch the goodness of Wild Cow's version. The other day I grabbed takeout with a friend, and that process was really easy and the food equally insane. I had the garlicky kale as well as the sweet potato and black bean tacos. They are SOOOOOOO good. I'm making similar tacos at home this week because I couldn't get enough. They're killer. We also got the vegan queso; it wasn't my favorite. It wasn't bad at all, and if one day I do cut dairy out of my diet, I could see where I would be a fan. What was AMAZING though, is the salsa they also include with the chips and queso. It.was.INSANE. I kept saying 'Mmmm I love this salsa!\" until my friend was like \"yeah, got it, Sarah.\" ;)I can't wait to go back and try even more yummy things at The Wild Cow. It's proof that eating healthfully and veggie based is still decadent and delicious.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The restaurant is quite small, with a bunch of pictures and art, mostly animals, lots of colors, some  people will call it hipster. The waitresses are polite, however they need to take care of their personal appearance. Because you are maybe vegan does not mean you need to look like a vagabond, stop promoting stereotypes. But wait... The place is not that big and you have to wait quite a while for your food. So? The food is very good. Despite everything else the taco sampler is amazing and the salads are great, the details on each plate is supreme.

    "comments": "The Wild Cow is a vegetarian/vegan cafe in East Nashville (just around the corner from their other vegetarian/vegan cafe Graze). My mom (who is vegan) was visiting Nashville this week, and I decided to take her to The Wild Cow. She loved it (she's always thrilled to go to a place where she has a lot of options on the menu). I thought the food was pretty good, too. She ordered the special, which was a salad with a baked sweet potato, crumbled vegan sausage, vegan goat cheese, and other stuff on top. It wasn't something I would have ordered (it had a sweet dressing, and I prefer salty to sweet), but she liked it a lot, and I thought it was pretty okay, too. I ordered the vegan Reuben with tofu, which was actually really good! It was a thick slice of tofu, a lot of mustard, and sauerkraut. Simple and delicious. The Wild Cow is very small and can get busy. We went on a Sunday around 1 or 2, I think, and we did have to wait for a table (there were several parties waiting for a table). We ended up sitting at the bar so we didn't have to wait as long. The Wild Cow also has desserts that my mom raved about (she took a vegan mini peach pie home for a dessert later in the day). I'm a former vegan, now pescatarian, and I thought the Wild Cow was pretty good. Their menu wasn't anything inspired (mostly salad and rice bowls and sandwiches), but the food itself was fine. The service was really good as well! Not a place I would go out of my way to visit, but I'm sure I'll be here for a meal every time my mom visits, because she LOVED it (I think it's her favorite vegetarian place in Nashville so far - over Graze and Sunflower Cafe and Avo)!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The best, freshest food (vegan or otherwise) in the South that I've had since we moved out of Long Beach CA 6 years. I did a search for vegan in Nashville TN which was halfway on our trek to St Louis. I was glad to see a few places listed. I picked this because their dishes came with a side dish and we were hungry after driving 4.5 hours. I am so glad we chose Wild Cow. The ambience is very downtown hipstery. I'm not a wanna-be hipster like a lot of those young kids there, who aren't really countercultural, but look that way because it's \"in\". But I am a hippie. Plus I was also the only non-white, non-blonde (bleached it natural), tattoo free Asian woman there. I'm used to it;)So I liked that this place was pretty hipster and different from the restaurants down in good ole southern fried Auburn AL. And by the crowd there, it is a very popular local hangout. Was it really the food that packed the place? YES!!!!The food is amazingly tasty, well seasoned sauces, good portions for about $10 a plate. I'm not sure where the umami flavor comes from, maybe they make their own broth to cook with or something We ordered a chipotle seitan burrito, excellent bbq sauce that wasn't sweet or thick but so flavorful. The hummus and chips side dish was okay. It wasn't smooth the way I like it, needs more lemon and tahini. But my husband said it was good for an American restaurant.I ordered the sweet potato and black bean taco. It was the only GF taco they had so i didn't have much choice. They give you 2 tacos with roasted double corn tortillas, which I always end up removing the bottom tortilla to get more taste of the filling. It was good but it's hard to cover up the sweetness of the sweet potato and I really wanted more of the umami flavor so make sure to order a side of vegan sour cream for 25 cents. The best part was the garlicky kale. Everyone on yelp raved about it and I'm raving too. Fresh well seasoned and just enough garlic with a good sauté of butter or whatever they use. Overall it was awesome! We will definitely stop by Nashville on our way home to try out  other vegan places like Graze and Sunflower Cafe.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I've been living in small town USA for a few years where vegan/vegetarian options are very few and far between, so when I decided to visit Nashville, I was excited to discover some delicious food I didn't have to make myself. A quick Yelp search led me to this place, and I'm really glad it did. This place has a very fun and upbeat atmosphere, the food is delicious, and service is quick.I arrived about 45 minutes before they closed at 10 on a Monday night thinking I would encounter some unhappy employees about me coming so soon before they closed. Wow, was I wrong. I guess it really has been that long since I've been in a big city. The place was packed. I actually had to wait for a seat, but it wasn't too long. Since it was just me, I sat at the counter and I saw some really appetizing plates of food pass me by. I opted for the buffalo bowl with rice and avo. I really enjoyed it.

The seitan taco was actually one of the best tacos I've ever had of any kind and the other two were pretty good as well. My wife had a veggie burger (black bean based) and though she generally is not a veggie burger kind of person (or huge fan of black beans), she really enjoyed it and was surprised at how tasty it was. Great selection of coffee, teas, craft brews. Tasty sides as well. Great location but fills up quickly, at least it did when we were there but it was worth a 15 minute wait.

    "comments": "I kind of make it a point to seek out vegetarian/vegan options whenever I travel. This place popped up while in Nashville for work, and with such high reviews, I had to visit! It is a tiny little place that apparently frequently has a wait. I ordered to go (which, dumb me, should've called my order in) and then sat on the bench they had to wait. No other seating to wait inside, which makes it a little cramped. But if you're dining in, they will take your phone number or email address (can't remember which) and give you a buzz when your table is ready. There were quite a few tables that were just nursing coffee/tea and studying or listening to music, which I think is kind of frustrating. This place seems to be operating more as a restaurant than coffee shop, so I would think they'd try to turn the tables over a little quicker when they're that busy. Anyway, the cashier was nice and the order took about 20-30 minute to fill. It is very loud in there so be sure to pay attention for them to call your name!As for the food, I was super indecisive. The taco sampler seemed like a good variety and selection, so opted for that and a side of chips and queso. Pretty fairly priced for the quantity and quality (about $15 for 3 tacos and a small bag of chips and queso.) The sweet potato and black bean taco was SO sweet. I went in thinking that would be my favorite, but the sweet potato seemed to overpower everything. Definitely didn't have the kick that I would expect from jerk sauce. The peanut tempeh taco was pretty good! Definitely peanut-y, but I still can't get past the texture of tempeh when most people cook it. It's rare for me to LOVE tempeh. However, the chipotle seitan taco was AMAZING. I was so full, but I basically inhaled it. Flavorful and fresh. The chips were fine, nondescript and the queso really was just melted cashew cheese. I was hoping for more traditional tex mex style with some peppers and tomatoes.I would definitely go back in the future, but will try to find the rare time it's not packed! Lucky Nashville to have this place in their backyard. :)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The prices are very fair. There is nothing above $12. Their beer selection is wonderful.I brought my mom here while she was in town (she's a big meat eater) and she loved it!

Artichoke and spinach dip - Amazing! Addicting! This is probably one of their best selling appetizers. It's not overpowering in either vegetable and it's just blended so well. Taco sampler plate: chipotle seitan, peanut tempeh, black bean and rice. These were the best tacos I've ever had. The sauce, the texture, the amount of stuffing, the portion. They aced it all.  Green tea smoothie - very strong banana taste. The consistency was perfectly smooth but the strong banana taste really killed it. I felt like I was drinking a banana smoothie with a hint of matcha. Potassium punch smoothie - This was quite interesting. Although the banana taste was dominant the other ingredients gave it a kick. Overall, it's a small place, crowded, has decent prices, a friendly atmosphere and there tends to be a wait line.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The service was so friendly-- our waiter explained everything on the menu in detail, including how certain items were made, and customized dishes as we needed. The food tastes fresh and healthy, and you can see them making everything custom to order...not a buffet line where everything was made hours ahead and is just heated up under lights. We had the hummus (a side portion, more than large enough for an appetizer for two), portobello bowl, and lentil bowl. The hummus was really fresh and not oily, the lentil bowl was warm and filling (highly recommend adding spinach or something to lighten it up, though), and the portobello bowl was light and flavorful. All for very reasonable prices.... the hummus was only $3.5! We did not have room for dessert, but they have tons of vegan treats if you do not want to check out the other great options in the shopping center. The only reason this is not 5 is because it is really small and so, so, so hipster...ok for groups of 2-4, but definitely no larger than that, and I could see this spot having an insane wait at certain times.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

FOODWe started with the chips and vegan cheese appetizer. The chips were ok (unclear if fried, but good ground blue corn if not a little light on texture). The vegan cheese dip was pretty good for not being cheese and had a flavor that reminded me of nacho cheese. Reminded, not tasted -- still good. Even better was the tomatillo (and maybe avocado?) salsa. Yum!I got a lentil bowl and added kale. The lentils are described as stewed and are served over brown rice. I found the ratio of rice to other stuff to be a little too high, but it was an easy fix not to eat all the rice. With a little less rice, it would be the perfect ratio to mix and eat it all. Considering we ate an appetizer, I easily got away eating enough food just scraping all the top flavor off the bowl. The lentils come with some garlic aioli on top, too -- might not be a bad idea to ask for it on the side if you like to self dose.I got the Potassium smoothie (coconut water, avocado, bananas, and kale). It was served in a frozen glass that kept the smoothie nice and cold while I drank it.SERVICEOur server was attentive and checked in frequently. I never noticed my water glass less than a quarter full. Service was prompt and pleasant. I loved how one of the servers had face paint on as makeup. It looked great!DECORQuirky and cute! Lots of custom art on the walls and tons of color. The environment feels warm and friendly and just a little weird, in a great way.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This is vegan food for a town with little to no veggie options and thus no idea what good vegan food is. Vegan 101, that's for sure.The queso tasted exactly like the vegan block cheese you would get from the grocery store - either daiya and follow your heart, not sure which brand. It even had that signature neon orange color one would only find in a chemical vegan cheese. It was the consistency of water and seriously lacked flavor. They should have offered a cashew based queso with nutritional yeast plus spices and peppers instead of what I am almost positive is store bought with nothing added to it to at least mask the plastic, chemical flavor. The buffalo tempeh's sauce was good, but it needed something else added to it in order to create a more complex flavor. Almost nothing was done to the tempeh to truly transform it. I'm not even sure if they steamed it first, because it had that bitter aftertaste. It was tempeh literally just cut into strips and slathered with sauce. It was not even pan fried for texture, so the result was soggy.The bowls were good, but very simple and basic. I could have easily made it at home. Nothing inspired or to write home about.Lastly, I was disappointed there was no seitan or a vital wheat gluten creation. The only faux meat offerings were soy products in the form of tofu and tempeh. I think that is a little lazy, since the soy products are merely cut up and thrown together here. Overall, this place is a pretty basic vegan restaurant, lacking both vision and flavor. I had high expectations, but was disappointed. It is definitely vegan/vegetarian food for beginners.

No reservations taken, short wait for lunch.  It was tempted to completely bypass the healthy and head across the street for chips and salsa at RosePepper or around the corner for Jeni's. BUT,  did not and was glad about it.  Sweet potato tacos with black beans and salsa.  Packed completely full where 1 was really enough and I took taco #2 home.  Humus with more substance than most.  Guacamole also thick and chunky.  Ordered raspberry iced tea and it was not just a hint of raspberry flavor but really solid raspberry taste!  Am sure if you are vegan/vegetarian (I am not), Wild Cow will not disappoint and you will want to return.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Meaning there were folks on bikes, couples walking dogs, and cleanish hipsters folks just abounded. This place is vegan first and foremost and they definitely have thought of any and all mods one might want to make to their menu and lay it out along with any associated charge upfront rather than playing the \"can you?\" Game and there being an unexpected bill at the end. I had the veggie burger picnic style with pineapple slaw and bbq sauce and it was a delight in a whole wheat bun. You have the choice of at least 5 sides including sweet potato mash, chickpea salad, chips and salsa, veggies of the day, pineapple coleslaw, and more that isn't coming to mind. I had a harder time with picking a side than my meal (I did however end up at the sweet potato mash). For the burger, add on condiments, and a hard cider my bill came to $16. A deal if I say so myself.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The Philly absolutely blew my mind!!!! The Seitan Tacos were also delicious, served with a delightful Salsa Verde. It's a small restaurant so be prepared to wait! They quoted us 20 minutes at 2pm but it was really probably less than ten minutes. Either way, IT'S SO WORTH THE WAIT! Please open up a Wild Cow in Knoxville!!!!ALL HAIL SEITAN!!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Seriously try it. It's hearty but doesn't leave you feeling lethargic thanks to all the whole foods. Seriously amazing. The husband had the Philly cheesesteak and really enjoyed.

The side of spinach dip was also great! I was expecting it to be cold, but it didn't matter once I started chowing down with the good ole' non-GMO blue corn chips.Overall great place!

Most of the menu is vegan and they have plenty of creative options. The Super Burrito special caught my eye, so I went with that. It was warm and flavorful. Coming from the perspective of a northerner, I'd say this was great soul food. The kale was fresh and didn't have too much garlic. They have desserts from Vegan Vee and the options range from cookies to cakes and more. The Pumpkin \"Cream Cheese\" cupcake was outstanding. For drinks, they have wine (at the very least) and plenty of natural sodas and juices. The drink prices were very reasonable too. I was also given a large glass of ice water. One of my pet peeves is getting a tiny cup of water at a restaurant! For food, I'd say the prices are moderate, but are a good value given the quality and portions. The best part of my experience here was definitely the service. My waitress was very attentive and friendly, checking back several times to make sure I was completely satisfied.I highly recommend The Wild Cow. I disagree with the reviews that label this place as a pretentious/hipster place. I've been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants over the years and it was very low key here. The staff were are all very nice, not standoffish like at some truly pretentious places.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ordered the Veggie burger served picnic style (pineapple cole slaw with BBQ sauce) paired with your choice of one side- pretty darn delicious to be honest.The Hubs ordered the Black bean and rice tacos- they were paired with the best flour tortillas we've had since moving from Texas. Mainly because they were handmade and not store bought like every other Mexican restaurant here (but I digress). The flavor of the tacos was explosive and satisfied my Hispanic husbands craving.But the real show stopper was the Lemon Raspberry cake with white chocolate icing. HOLY CRAP. This vegan cake (yes, vegan) was probably the best cake I've EVER had. This cake is crack. Can't wait to come back and take a break from our typical beefy fried southern diet.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We frequent this place at least twice a week and they have the best quality food, best fresh ingredients! Their buffalo tempeh strips get me every time.. I don't even know how they do it, but I don't care.. I'm in love! Their veggie burgers are soy free black bean burgers that taste as close to the real deal as you can get! My husband says the philly cheese steak is the best he's had yet, veggie and non veggie included.. Great food, great people! We love The Wild Cow! :)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Usually stuck eating salads and pasta, I set the bar pretty low when getting quality healthy meals on the road. When I landed in Nashville I did my normal Yelp search of Vegetarian restaurants in the area and found The Wild Cow and figured I would try it out since it was only 15 minutes from my hotel.The second I walked in I knew that the food would exceed my expectations. It is a quaint hipster-esque restaurant with waiter service and about 20 small tables. Everyone there was extremely helpful and gave great recommendations. They were not pushy or pretentious at all which often is the case with natural places like this.I was hungry and wanted to test their best so I had the Veggie Quinoa Bowl with added Tempeh, Kale and Avocado ($11.75 with all add-ins). This was a huge portion and was packed with healthy flavors. If you're a fan of garlic, this dish will not disappoint. For dessert I got the Chocolate Ganache cake ($5.75) which was stellar. I am never a fan of gluten free or vegan foods, but somehow they made this chocolate cake amazing.This restaurant serves food on par with my favorite restaurant at home (yelp.com/biz/life-alive-…) and am telling all my friends that pass through Nashville to stop at this gem, even if they're carnivores.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "When planning our Nashville TN vacation, the Wild Cow was recommended by several friends and colleagues as the go to place for vegetarian and vegan food in the city. As such, Brittany A. and I made it one of our first stops when we arrived in Nashville. The Wild Cow is located in a newer mixed use development in East Nashville and neighbors several other exciting eateries. I would suggest arriving as early as possible to avoid the lunch time rush since there is virtually no waiting space in the restaurant. Our wait was about 20 minutes on a Saturday, which we found acceptable. As a long time vegetarian, I was very excited about the breadth of their menu. I focused on the sandwich section of the menu that features vegetarian versions of many popular sandwiches, like a vegan Philadelphia cheese steak, a Reuben, or a French Dip. I settled for their soy-free homemade black bean veggie burger, which for a $1 surcharge you can add grilled onions, thousand island dressing, and mustard to make it \"animal style\" a la In N Out Burger. Brittany A. opted for their Wild Reuben.Our orders were prepared quickly and served to our table piping hot. I doubt my experience from here will be echoed by most reviewers of the restaurant. I've tried many veggie burgers across the United States and two aspects that are crucial above all others is to not overcook the patty especially when it is made with black beans, and ensure ample add ons that provide extra juiciness. Recalling the animal style entrees of In N Out, I was expecting the veggie burger to be drenched in sauce. As you can tell from the photo below, there was barely enough sauce present to cover half of the top bun. The flavor of the veggie patty did not wow me, and was not much of a cut above frozen patties I've purchased in my local grocer's freezer. For my side item, I opted for the mashed sweet potatoes. These were the highlight of my meal, full in flavor but not too dense. Brittany A. had a wonderful culinary experience with her entree, so I suspect that my dish is an outlier to their normal preparation and technique. Next time we are in town I will definitely try the Wild Cow again with a different entree.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Originally had not planned to stop by The Wild Cow, but decided to get some smoothies to go on our way back to Atlanta. Smoothie run turns into small dinner date with evening smoothies and a delicious vegan/gluten-free oatmeal cookie for the trip, but first the tacos.We tried a soup of the day and a standard house salad with sweet mustard dressing and a taco sampler plate. Everything about all of it was surprising and delicious and amazing and.. and.. and.. ungh. No, really. Now I know where to get some crazy good vegan or vegetarian food in Nashville. They even have a nice stable of gluten-free options which I'm always down for trying and exploring.  The soup of the day was a spinach and lentil + beets soup, if I can recall? I could be horribly wrong, but it was pretty good. Refreshing sort of soup with a dollop, of possibly, vegan sour cream. The salad completely above and beyond. Alfalfa sprouts, sunflower seeds, pickled beets, finely shredded carrots and the works. I figured it'd be like any old standard salad... with a handful of leaves. It was decent sized for a side salad, though in comparison to their regular salad entrees was a teaspoon wee thing. It also was pretty inexpensive.The taco sampler was a perfect choice to figure out how awesome or maybe how not awesome their tacos were. The verdict for us was very awesome. Flour tortillas with a side of blue corn chips and a green salsa. The tacos were creative and colorful and very filling. We chose the chipotle & seitan, peanut tempeh, and a sweet potato & black bean taco. Honestly, it was hard to choose a favorite. I'd probably end up getting this taco sampler every time I stopped in if I lived near by.One criticism is the smoothie list isn't very extensive. It was a mixture of the same ingredients while interchanging one or two items, however, what they have they do very well. So definite recommend for a quick fix.Lastly, the desserts. I don't know how awesome all of them are, but the oatmeal cream pie I tried was absolutely top notch. I really have nothing but praise for this place. This place ranks up as an awesome go-to spot for vegan eats in Nashville. Definite recommend for any vegan or gluten-free lifestyles or just anyone who's looking to try some fantastic food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Unfortunate, but I'll chalk it off to an isolated incident.I stupidly ordered a bunch of sides because I couldn't make my mind up on an entree and because the couscous salad sounded too good. Sadly, it was not to my liking (rather bland) and the veg of the day, not my thing (should have asked... all my fault). Regardless of my little mishap, I'll keep it to five stars because the other things I've had here are just *that* good. Also, I love the sweet, informative staff. This is a great place to bring someone who is veg-curious because the staff's enthusiasm is infectious! Wild Cow. I salute you.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Add some kale) and I got roasted veggies over quinoa, avec kale.  Both were delish.  We left perfectly satiated.  One more evening to go in Nashville and we will be returning for an encore.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Unlike many other reviewers here, we had no wait. We were greeted and seated immediately, our server was mad cool, and the food was as good as it gets, vegan or otherwise. When I moved to Nashville from LA I thought I had to start eating dairy again, simply because there aren't many vegan choices in Nashville. Tonight, I was proven wrong. I want to eat here every day. I ordered the Taco combo and every bite was an out-of-this-world tastebud sensation, better than anything I ever ordered from any vegan restaurant in Los Angeles. These guys really know what they're doing. It is modestly priced, their portions are more than filling (I had to get a to-go box), and it's just all-around excellent.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Not that I recommend doing that necessarily, but it was a delicious way to sit in dead stopped traffic. Midway through the container I heard this loud honk and I look up and see this trucker next to me giving me a thumbs up, which was hilarious and also cool. When I got home I ate the rest of the kale (I got two sides of kale...I know it should be the easiest thing to make, but I can't get it right at home and NO ONE makes it like Wild Cow!!!) and my lentil stew. They gave me a nice big portion; I was so satisfied and happy. I have a few favorites from this place, and these two things are among them.

    "comments": "I challenge any meat eater to come to The Wild Cow and not leave a fan. The food is extremely tasty. The mission is admirable. The service is fun. The dining room is... packed. What do you expect? It's a vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Eastwood. There's little chance that it's not going to be crazy busy. That said, I have never had to wait on a table. I suppose I have good timing when it comes to sitting down to some meatless eats. I won't proselytize about the virtues of eating meatless but know that doing so is good for your body and the environment. Don't get me wrong: I will go to town on some hot chicken but I have, largely, weaned myself off of beef and pork (I have the occasional relapse) and don't miss it all that much. If I ate like I was at TWC everyday, I wouldn't miss it at all.  The vibe is akin to what you might find in the Bay Area -- and that's not an insult. There's an inviting BoHo feeling from the energy and servers that make you feel comfortable. It's almost as though there's ambient good karma floating around. You can't eat karma, however, so let's get to the business of the food and drink. I tend to stay away from seitan.  Much like the name implies, it's evil and will do horrible things to your stomach so I don't come here in search of meat substitutes. When I eat this way, I prefer to go all in. My go-to is the chick pea wrap. You know what it is? It's the pickles. Yes, the flavor of the wrap and freshness of the vegetables are big pluses but the pickle add crunch and flavor that send the wrap to the next level. I almost can't not get the wrap... which is too bad because there's so much good food from which to choose... which leads to me ordering too much. Yes, Virginia: it's possible to be a fat vegetarian. If you plan to join me in the truffle shuffle start with the spinach & artichoke dip. I don't know how they make it taste so good but there's no way you'll know it's vegan. You'll want to inhale an order all to yourself. I've also enjoyed a green garlic soup, garlicky kale and their flagship Caesar salad which, again, will make you wonder how in the world it's vegan.The drinks are equally wondrous. I'm not much of a coffee man but I have it on good authority that it's quality fare. I am, however, a juice man. Their watermelon mint concoction made me sing. Crisp, refreshing, fresh, invigorating... am I missing some words? I tried to savor it because I didn't want it to end but I couldn't stop sipping. I'd buy it by the gallon. Also delicious, their smoothies. I came to TWC after a pretty strenuous workout and I made a beeline for the chocolate, peanut butter and banana smoothie made with almond milk. So.damn.good. TWC does it and does it and does it well. It's as good as it gets -- not just for vegetarian/vegan fare but for food in general. If you live in Nashville, have the means and haven't tried it out yet... well, we probably need to take a break.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I think some vegetarians would agree that once you walk into a vegetarian-specific restaurant it can feel overwhelming. We are accustom to a quick process of elimination when we dine with friends, family, and enemies. It's a nice change of pace to walk into a place like Wild Cow and have soooo many options.I went with the French Quarter Dip with hummus and chips as my side. I am a little bit out of practice on the au jus dipping technique, but my loaded up sandwich quickly deconstructed after a bite or two. The jus was tasty, warm, and flavorful which was perfect for a chilly December day. I would recommend the hummus as a very fresh, light side option for you veg heads.My meal ended with a delectable dessert  from Khan's Desserts. I'm fairly confident my peanut butter frosted brownie was laced with awesome sauce and topped with \"hot damn this is delicious\" spread. Get one. For the sake of all things dessert, get one.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "With a traveling job that involves eating out for every meal, I've been hunting for more healthy options on the go and have recently jumped (halfway) on the vegan/vegetarian bandwagon to avoid exploding to epic proportions. Although I am by no means a vegetarian, I have come to appreciate the creativity that goes into herbivore-friendly dishes. The Wild Cow was a chance stumble after I tried to dine at the nearby Silly Goose and found that it was closed on Mondays (I may have skipped the fine lines on the website). A small but bustling little place, the Wild Cow epitomized the eccentric hipster hangout spot. With bright colorful walls, odd decorations, and artsy diners, the place created its own personality. Based on the recommendation of my waitress, I ordered the Beans & Greens dish. You had the option of brown rice or quinoa (I chose the latter) and tofu or tempeh (I ordered half and half) with avocado as an extra addition (of course I got it). It arrived with their garlicky kale, beans, and carrot shavings mixed together in a colorful bowl with the aforementioned toppings above, drizzled graciously with buffalo sauce.My only mistake was ordering a Green Tea (matcha & banana) Smoothie which arrived and was consumed way before my actual meal resulting in a lack of stomach space for the entree. The smoothie was AMAZING and I would go back just to drink it again.I noticed the menu also had a drink called Buchi Kombucha (say what?) that came in the flavors of Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. After a quick search on my phone, I learned that this was a brewed drink with a bacterial culture that toted a whole slew of health benefits so naturally, I ordered one to go. Curiosity killed the cat, and in this case, it was a puckered death because the experience was rather like drinking vinegar straight from the bottle. Quite the experience, yolo!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

(Wait time for a table was over an hour.) Having been traveling all afternoon, we opted for a to-go order. There was absolutely nowhere to sit while we waited half an hour for our order. It's a considerably small place, even the patrons who were dining seemed crowded. The food was satisfactory, and they boast a massive dessert selection! A couple staff members seemed stuck-up, which is unbecoming for a dining experience that is supposed to promote equality.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Make sure to add avocado and the fajita style seitan.  The buffalo beans and greens is to die for as a main course. You may want to order the chōcaláte, peanut butter and banana smoothie to hep cool the spice.

Everything on the menu is great.  I've had the nachos, the queso, far eastland bowl, a lot of the sandwiches, and all the tacos & I've never had anything that I didn't like.  They also have a cool assortment of different drinks like organic sodas & teas.  The desserts are TO DIE FOR.  They are some of the best I've ever had!! So don't leave without getting a cupcake or something.  Prices are reasonable like 7-10 bucks per dish.  My friend and I went there one time and I paid for her and we got two entrees & drinks & it was like 25-28 bucks somewhere in that ball park! I recommend this place!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, I just think the food tastes great.The servers are all really funky, which just adds to my enjoyment (Sorry if that sounds rude!). My favorite server always dresses like an 80's hair-metal punk rocker, which I love. I've been here many times already and always enjoy the food. My favorite/go-to is the Chipotle Seitan Tacos--YUM!!Portions are pretty big generally. We used to get an appetizer along with dinner and we'd be stuffed full. Especially the nachos--which ROCK if you get seitan on them.One complaint is that they are almost always sold out of their special, which is a huge bummer! The few times we were able to order the special, it was always great.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

That being said, I don't eat meat for every meal, or even every day, and always believe in eating healthy and organic whenever possible. After eating authentic BBQ chicken the day before, because heck, you have to at least once in Tennessee, we came here to give our tummies some wholesome goodness. I like a vegetarian restaurant that calls themselves \"The Wild Cow\". Cute. The wait was going to be about thirty minutes, enough time to scour the menu and decide what we were going to chow down on. We started with the buffalo seitan strips and fresh squeezed watermelon mint juice. I got the veggie burger California style with a side of homemade hummus and chips, the boy got the soft tortillas with black beans and sweet potatoes with the garlicky kale. We both really liked the seitan strips, however we both would have liked more of the buffalo sauce which was pretty good. A little too dry for my taste, I would have much preferred an extra side of the buffalo instead of the vegan ranch. My burger was okay, not bad but not outstanding. I've had better. (Cue sequence from Liar, Liar). The hummus was pretty good, but VERY garlicky. I tried some of the boy's dish, the kale and the tortillas. The tortillas I thought were pretty good, very interesting combination. And the kale, well, let's just say if Dracula were to come into the Cow, we'd all be saved. Yes, it's THAT garlicky. The watermelon mint juice was definitely very fresh. However, I didn't detect a single iota of mint, nor a mint leaf. It was a bit expensive for the amount that they give you ($3.75), but I guess you need a lot of watermelon to make 6 oz of juice? I can't be sure, as I've never juiced a watermelon, but maybe I should try. As others have stated, the service can be a bit hit-or-miss, however the one waiter who kept refilling our water glasses was super nice and super attentive. When I told him my Cali burger didn't have the Cali fixings (avocado and sprouts), he promptly brought me a generous side of the items. I'd definitely come back next time I make it to Nashville, because I think this could be a solid 4-star and not a shaky 3.5. Plus, I'd like to try the ice cream joint next door which had a line around the block. And, I am still kind of mad that I didn't buy the \"Hail Seitan\" t-shirt for $15.

Wish there were more places like this in town that serves more than the typical rabbit food options. Let's begin with a bang......So I walk in to the Wild Cow with my mom...and we get seated in a booth...and as I look around (natural Navy Seal training safety and security tactics)...I immediately spot the British actor, Sam Palladio, who stars in the Nashville show. Oh what a hottie! He is quietly sitting a few tables from me, probably 123* SE.  And for those of you wondering...NO..I did not stare at him, take a picture of him, selfie with him, attack him, engage him, interrogate him, sabotage him, disturb him, or any other crazy thing. I just identified him, made eye contact, and winked with a cheesy smile. Ok enough of Nashville celebs in our local places...let's now ease in into our restaurant...The food was phenomenal. I wanted to come here bc not only did they offer vegetarian food, they also had many gluten-free options on their menu. That's definitely a plus for those of us trying to go paleo. Both my mom and me ordered the bowls. I picked brown rice and she picked quinoa. Her quinoa was topped with grilled veggies and tempeh and my brown rice was topped with garlicky kale, BBQ tofu, carrots, beans, and a couple other veggies. The portions were so big that we had to take half of our serving home for the next day's lunch! The taste was yummy! The service was quick and friendly. The ambience was fresh. The prices were $9! I'm coming back! I loved it! Can't wait to see what other famous person I can spot there and what yumilicious food I can eat next! The wild cow...I'm retreating temporarily.

    "comments": "Good option for all us veggies out there when you don't wanna make dinner. My husband and I went one night a couple weeks ago. He chose the Philly sandwich with grilled bbq tofu for his side and I chose buffalo tofu grinder made as a wrap with the daily special cheesy brussel sprouts for my side. His Philly was good with a bite of everything together. I'm not a huge fan of the veggie versions of stuff like this so the \"meat\" alone wasn't my favorite. The tofu wasn't very firm so that was kind of disappointing. My wrap was really good. Same for the tofu on this but the flavors made up for the consistency of the tofu. The brussels were good but mushy. More of a casserole flavor than crisp, fresh brussel sprouts with cheese. All in all, I have been to Wild Cow a couple of times and I'll go back to try other things, but to me it isn't out of this world vegetarian fare. Nice to have this restaurant as an option though.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

But it seems like everything I get tastes pretty much the same. If you're looking for a place that as a Veg you can order anything off the menu, go. But it seems that many of the vegetarian meals I get at non-vegetarian specialty restaurants impress me more. The desserts.Every time I go to the Wild Cow, I try a dessert. I'm trying to expand my taste buds and learn to enjoy vegan desserts. It's not working. I know plenty of people like the Khan's cupcakes and the other local bakers that the Wild Cow supports, but again... they are mediocre for me. The service is always just okay.

As time went on, the menu got bigger, dishes got better and better, and the traffic followed, which was amazing. However, as the word grew, so did the staff, and I don't know where these moody people came from but majority of the waiters, hosts, and cashiers there now are so incredibly rude that I literally can't eat there anymore. The last three times I've visited, I've left feeling let down. In fact, the last time I visited, the couple next to us commented on the rude staff was to us before they left. And I get it, I was a server at one point so I understand the stress of working at a restaurant but what gives? Either way, again, everything else about this place is great (besides the wait time, but that's a given when food is good)! I really miss The Wild Cow's food a lot and hoping this negativity changes soon.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's a small space (I would guess they can seat 30 people if every chair is taken) and pretty loud inside. I had the black bean burger which comes with a side.  The burger well seasoned and reasonably moist, my side of chick pea salad was seasoned with fresh herbs and resembled the texture of chicken salad. My dining companion enjoyed the portabella quinoa bowl which had lots of olive and sundried tomato flavor. The prices are reasonable and our waiter was attentive. The bathroom was very unpleasant and parking was very difficult (we walked about 4 blocks and that was as close as we could get with a legal parking space).\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm Lebanese and  have tried about every hummus under the sun and The Wild Cow's is the best I've ever tried I wanted to pack it up and take it to California with me! My mom had the lentil bowl which I had some of and added kale. Their garlic aioli is MAGICAL.

When she mentioned \"Vegetarian Restaurant\" I huffed and I puffed. But, happy wife = happy life. So we went to the Wild Cow Vegetarian Restaurant.We will thrilled with our dining experience there. Their burger special of the day was a BBQ bourbon black bean burger. While the black beans caused me pause, I couldn't resist the sound of that. My wife ordered the reuben. I questioned how a restaurant could make a reuben without corned beef, but I withheld judgement until the food arrived.Expectations were demolished. My burger was delicious. The BBQ bourbon sauce must have been homemade and while I did miss the juiciness of a nice thick ground beef patty, the toppings and sauce compensated perfectly. There was a jalapeño coleslaw that brought just the right amount of bite and tanginess to the burger. YUM. And, while the Irish in me mourned at the thought of a reuben made of tofu, I have to admit that it too was delicious. It actually tasted like corned beef! What the what?!And finally, when our server found out we were on a roadtrip honeymoon, she brought us a cupcake for dessert. It was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.

I was obviously upset and asked the girl one more time when my order FINALLY came out, what the deal was, she explained that there were just that many orders that were in line before us.  Again no sorry unless you count the weak apology when I said that the service was really unbelievable.  It would have been a very common practice to rush our to go order after we had called it in in advance and dined in for an entire meal.  I will not be returning here.  I left a tip out of habit and cannot believe I did that.  Shame on me for in any way communicating a mixed message that I was happy with any part of our experience today.  I am supremely disappointed in my neighborhood restaurant.  But like I said, only a few meals worth going in for and the service is never very hospitable.  Today they were just at their worst.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ended up taking the hummus back to my hotel and snacking on it the next day. It was, hands down, the best hummus I've ever had.

    "comments": "The Wild Cow is THE place to go for vegan. The burger is always great no matter how you order it. The Muppet Style isn't listed on the menu anymore, but you can still get it. With their signature green dressing, avocado, and sprouts, the Muppet Style is my favorite when I'm in the mood for a burger I can really sink my teeth into. My husband - normally a carnivore - really likes the buffalo \"chicken\" sandwich. I've tried it several times as well & I can attest to its tastiness. The sauce, the texture....it's all great. In my opinion, the very best item on the menu is the quinoa & veggie bowl. It doesn't sound all that exciting, but I order it with tempeh & the peanut aioli sauce and it's incredible! Aside from the food, the restaurant is always clean & service is always good. This place has definitely gained popularity in the last few years, so it's usually crowded & you should expect a wait. It's worth it, but there's no real waiting area so you might ending up standing awkwardly in the doorway. Also, parking is a nightmare. This, obviously, is not indicative of how you'll like the restaurant, but I have to include it because it's truly horrendous. Don't wear stiletto heels. All in all, The Wild Cow is really cool - good food at good prices, an ideal place to meet with friends or have a casual lunch date, and even the meat-eaters in your party will find something they like.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My brother helped me move to Nashville and I decided to treat him to lunch. He's a vegan, so most places only have one (MAYBE two) dishes that he can eat. So I decided to research a little bit before we got here and Wild Cow seemed like the go-to spot for vegetarians and vegans. We were here on a Sunday afternoon and it was extremely busy, and people were waiting outside. Overall they seemed to move things along pretty quickly and we were seated after about 20-25 minutes.The restaurant is fairly small in size (kind of a \"hole in the wall\" type of place) but has a really good feel to it. You don't feel cramped or like you're sitting on top of the next table, so that was nice. The service was excellent throughout the meal as well. The woman who helped us was very friendly and explained many of the dishes to my mother and myself (considering we're carnivores, some things needed explanation) and even gave lots of recommendations to all of us.We started out with the nachos which were really damn good. Better than most nachos I've had anywhere else. My brother and I both had The Philly, which is basically like a vegan cheesesteak. The texture of the \"meat\" (seitan in this one) is definitely different than real meat, but the taste is actually really good. I found it to be a touch salty, but overall it was good. My mom had the Beans & Greens with quinoa and she really liked it a lot. I tasted it and the flavor was definitely good, although I'm not the fondest of kale so that might have skewed my opinion. My brother and I also got some of their cupcakes to go. We had the Mochaccino and Lavender. The Mochaccino was excellent, and I loved the slight coffee flavor to it. The cakes are definitely much more dense and slightly drier than a normal cake. But overall, I was pretty impressed considering they were vegan.Overall, this place is a GREAT alternative for vegans and vegetarians. They have a ton of options that they don't get at normal restaurants. Even as a meat eater, I really enjoyed the meal as a whole. This is definitely a place I'll check out again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to both vegans and carnivores!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

That, and for a busy saturday night, it was completely understaffed, the only host was running all over bussing tables, taking takeout orders, answering phones, just like telling customers a general direction of their table, and for being probably the hardest overworked person there, she was the ONLY decently nice one. Blue hair takeout lady was a nightmare, just so amazingly rude. And the whole thing just seemed sort of unsanitary with so many people going from bussing tables and going straight to touching food and filling takeout orders, you need a busser or something to relieve your host so she can do a decent job and keep things sanitary.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My seatmate on my connecting flight from Dallas, however, turned out to be a vegetarian and not only provided an enthusiastic endorsement of Wild Cow, but offered me a ride to meet up with the nice woman from Nashvegan Meetup who offered to have dinner with me that night.  The three of us enjoyed all different things so we got to share some tastes -- Stephanie had the French Quarter dip, a seitan sandwich with a spicy dipping sauce, I got the tempeh reuben and Mike got a tempeh-quinoa bowl.  For dessert we got these incredibly delicious chocolate peanut butter bars that were probably 800 calories each but SO  TASTY!I ended up going back two days later for lunch with another woman from the Nashvegan list -- after our attempt to enter the Porter Flea failed (seriously - a 30-40 minute wait just to get in? were they giving away crack?).  I got the French Quarter dip sandwich this time - and tucked away ALL that seitan-y goodness - and Natasha had a big taco salad.  We also tried the spinach artichoke dip which was pretty good but not well served by the tortilla chips (maybe 25% less dip and some nice crostini instead would be an improvement).  And, of course - the chocolate peanut butter bars (YUM!).I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Nashville!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I had the tempeh buffalo grinder with a side of pineapple cole slaw on the first visit which were both amazing. Our second visit we shared an order of nachos as an app. I don't know what's in these nachos but I'm going to go w/ crack as they are all I can think about now. I have never had such amazing nachos IN MY LIFE. It was embarrassing how quickly they were gone. For dinner I went with the tempeh reuben (as good as I'd hoped) and a side of the garlicky kale (which I wasn't crazy about but that was probably more of a personal preference as opposed to anything wrong with it). The restaurant itself is adorable (small though, be prepared to wait if there's a crowd. totally worth it), and the wait staff attentive and charming. Am seriously considering a move to Nashville and I would say 50% of that desire is to be closer to this place. It's that good.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Of course, this is no secret and we did have to wait for about 15 minutes on a recent Thursday night.  But no worries because the food was worth a much longer wait.Our meal started with the the artichoke dip with crostini and buffalo tempeh. The tempeh had the perfect buffalo spice and the artichoke dip was abundantly creamy (we would have liked to order all the starters!). For mains we tried the taco sampler and French Dip sandwich Au Jus.  The tacos were fantastic (coming from an Austin native that is high praise; get a side of pinto beans too)  and the French dip seitan was wonderfully spiced, almost sweet, and the jus was good enough to drink!If that was not enough we ended with meal chocolate cake that was moist and had buttercream and genache frostings.   The service was attentive and the atmosphere laid back. I'm trying to visit for a second time this same trip!Open an outpost in Austin (please).\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was excited to try a place with so many good options for me, as my current city of residence doesn't offer many restaurants of this sort. Plus I looked on yelp and saw the stellar reviews! Anyway. We got to the joint, had a large group of people waiting to be seated ahead of us, so we patiently waited for our table to open up. One problem though? There was a single two person table that was available, yet the hosts were not seating it. Until 20 minutes later when they directed us to sit at that table. That was strange. I felt very rushed by our waitress, so asked a quick few questions to help me decide (between these two dishes, which is more popular? Etc) she advised me to get the black bean burger, which I customized to be party melt style. I asked to have the soup as my side, but she said they did not have soup that day despite it being written on the board behind the counter. Oh well. I went with the lentils instead. I ordered a beer from the list, which they also did not have, despite it ALSO being on the board behind the counter. The food came up quickly and the first note of my burger was great! But apparently that was the only place they put the sauce. And I  not someone who likes my food overly sauced by any means. The burger itself lacked flavor completely, though it Was quite large. The lentils were great, no complaints there. After dinner I asked about dessert, and like most of my inquiries, they were out. I would give this place another shot because I see that they have potential, but I fear other people might not have been so patient if they had has an experience like mine.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Very very very very hipsterish mixed with people who look like they just came from an Animal Liberation Front meeting.

There are only a few good seats in the place along the back wall and the rest of the seating options are horrible. People stare at you when you sit down and eat while they wait to be seated themselves. Talk about awkward!To start off: We had the Buffalo Tempeh Strips. This is Tempeh covered in Franks Red Hot warmed up and cut into long strips. (Something you can easily make at home and probably make it taste much better with your own rendition)For our actual meal: I tried to have the Reuben but they were out of Swiss, so then I had the Philly.  The Saitan was sodium packed and covered in vegan queso...It was so oily and disgusting, I couldn't even force it down.My husband had the Bean burger Animal Style. This was just inedible. If you have ever made your own bean burgers and loved them, most likely you will hate this version. It was mushy beyond belief and tasted just awful. The sides: Artichoke and basil hummus (Skip this side) & Garlicky greens.The garlicky greens were the highlight, but even then overwhelmingly salted.I feel bad saying such horrible things about this place, but someone had too!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I've learned to cook things I never knew how to cook before, and I've learned to like foods I had never tried before, and I've also come to really REALLY appreciate the food I put in my mouth. I'm sure it goes without saying, however, that one of the hardest parts about being vegan is the restaurant dilemma. I really don't want to order \"a salad no cheese, no bacon\" every time I'm eating out with friends or loved ones. It really is perplexing as to why our culture is so fixated on meat... But that's neither here nor there... and if \"here\" is at The Wild Cow, it's certainly not here. This place is a bloody haven for not just good food, but AMAZING, magical, shout-for-joy **vegan** fare!! I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. I think even I make the occasional mistake of thinking vegan means bland, but this most definitely is not. Everything that I've tried so far is SUPREMELY satisfying, and I really did have to ask the waiter, \"this 'cheeeeeeese' dip....it's really vegan?\" It really was vegan, folks. And it really was delicious. I also ordered the French Dip sandwich which I cannot recommend enough. I did not want to let a single bite go to waste. To top it all off, they have the most delightful beer menu for this kind of establishment this side of the Mississippi! The interior is quite small, but surprisingly fits a decent amount of hungry people in there. There is also plenty of free parking in the parking lot located just on the side of the complex its located within. Prices are super friendly, as are the staff. I'm not sure how this place has anything less than five stars, but I encourage you to go experience it for yourself - whether or not you're vegan.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Here's what's up: I'm a meat eater, but I don't mind eating this way. I've made the mistake several times in the past of ordering something that's clearly a replacement for something veggies/vegan eaters are missing. A good example would be vegan \"philly cheese steak\". There's no way that's going to taste the way I want it to, knowing I could just go out and get the real thing -- this type of ordering is 1000% my mistake and does not lead to a satisfying meal at all. I've had: two veggie burgers, the sweet potato and black bean tacos, and the lentil stew as a main course (can also be a side). The most successful food I've had here is the california style veggie burger (the animal style DID NOT taste right) and the lentil stew. The tacos lacked flavor: which seems to be a consistent criticism I have for this place -- there is so much flavor in vegetables and spices, but they seem to be afraid to take the food in a decisive direction. One other thing about the food: it's messy. Consistently messy. Like I should have a bib on when I eat here. Things are soupy/watery sometimes, which is a turn off. Dessert here is very enjoyable. I have a friend who visited with an egg allergy, and she was so excited to take home four desserts from this place. The service has been hit or miss. I'm relatively positive our server was DRUNK the last time we were here. Didn't seem to effect her service very much, past her acting drunk. Ultimately, I've found stuff I like, and my veggie/vegan friends love it. So I'll keep coming back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "A year later and another star gained. I went to their first vegetarian buffet on Tuesday, it was pretty good. The special rice though, I'm still uncertain what about it was special and the veggie chili I considered pretty darn weak, but overall the buffet was a success.The place was packed when we got there for the fist Tuesday veggie buffet, I imagine it will be packed again. The buffet was good enough to tempt me back into the place, which after my last visit I had no reason to bother, I'm now interested in seeing what they have back on the regular menu as if the buffet was decent the food may be significantly better.The place still screams to me that it needs more flavor, things still feel very dry and safe from spices unless you want to use some of their habenero extract on the table which is hot, not flavor, but it's reached tasty.The buffet was a logistical failure the first time, well, the paying was, as people tried to pay and leave and were lined 10 deep at times in a rather small place. Nothing like sitting butt-high to a line of people who just ate cabbage and are attempting to pay and poot on outside.At $10 for a buffet, it was worth it.I wish I saw the place so many people love in this place. I've been a veggie 27 years now and would very much love to see that place. I just like it.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "As a vegetarian family, we plan our trips around veg friendly stops. This was a gem! The wait staff was awesome and very kind to my son who had a tummy ache. We had been on the road for several hours, and we were all a little road weary. They made him a bland meal (on purpose) and suggested a raw ginger ale. Very helpful. I write about this first because that sort of attention is what impresses me the most. Now, the food: I had the veggie burger California style. It was delicious and fresh. The creamy avocado paired with the crunchy black bean burger on a toasted bun was delectable. The aioli was garlicky, but not too much, and had a sweet tang that accompanied the burger's savory flavor. The aioli also adorned my husband and daughter's selection of a lentil bowl on quinoa. Absolutely delicious and very filling. The food was freshly prepared and flavorful. Next, atmosphere: the only reason this is getting a four instead of a five is because the restaurant is crowded and very small. We sat at a table for four in a dark back corner. This was fine for us, but I can see it being a challenge for some folks. The music selection was a lovely throwback to my youthful days (I actually heard a My Bloody Valentine tune), and the artwork was interesting and varied. The overall tone of the restaurant was relaxed and, although a little hipster, not pretentious. Highly recommend for everyone except for those needing accessible space for wheelchairs or for other reasons. We WILL return!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had a chai-banana cinnamon smoothie, way too spicy, not well made, with cubes of ice(???) and chunks of banana, just terrible. I had a plate of nachos with 3 dips; the creamy artichoke, guacamole and vegan cheese. The artichoke deep is just fine but not more than that, the vegan cheese is awkward, very oily and tastes a little funny, and the guacamole has too much onion in it for my taste. Had a side of mashed sweet potatoes which had way too much cinnamon in it, couldn't even smell it. The only good thing about this experience was the 'vegan eve' gf-vegan cupcakes, absolutely delicious! The place is way too short on stuff. It was busy, the service wasn't good and the food took about 40 min to arrive. So, yes, I think they won't see much of me there again... Truly disappointing. The 2 stars are for great potential and concept, and nice decor and cupcakes.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Their veggie burger is, hands down, the best I have ever had (yes, that includes the frozen ones from Harris Teeter). And their garlicky kale is from another planet. The first 7-8 times I visited, I ordered the veggie quinoa bowl with tempeh and avocado and, like the creature of habit that I am, was hesitant to spread my wings. But I am now super into the lentil bowl with brown rice and am glad I made the plunge into a new menu item. The lentil bowl is hardy and flavorful and as of late, you can add garlicky kale to it, which is all a quasi vegan girl such as myself could ask for. Now I should warn you ... Sometimes the lines are long and parking is not easy. But I assure you, every time I have had a near death experience crossing Eastland Avenue from my car to the Cow's open doors, has been completely worth it. That kale is literally to die for.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

After reading all the stellar reviews, I was excited to check it out. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the amazing vegetarian options in the Detroit area (most notably Seva, Inn Season, and plethora of Middle-Eastern, Mediterranean and Mexican eateries), but my expectations were met with disappointment. Wild Cow had all the expected vegan/vegetarian offerings. I chose the taco salad and added the seitan and roasted peppers, although I should have probably tried something other reviewers raved about. I found my salad pretty bland, the chips mediocre and while the seitan was cooked well, it was pretty flavorless. I also ordered a beer, which was not filled all the way and was not very cold. Perhaps I just made a bad menu choice or maybe Nashville just doesn't have many vegetarian-friendly restaurants hence the stellar reviews, but I didn't find the restaurant as awesome as Yelp would indicate.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Some items here are worthy of 5-star status, namely the Quinoa Rice Bowl (assuming there aren't any truly unsalvageable veggies in the mix that week) and the French Dip. The latter, in particular, blew my mind. In this case, the vegan option has actually improved upon the meat version since French Dips always end up dried up. Using seitan takes care of that problem; the marinade is awesome, and the au jus tastes like the real thing! I'm not a big fan of anything that involves the vegan cheese, though, and I'd also say that I've had better veggie burgers.  On the whole, though, a fantastic find.NOTE: Save room for Jeni's next door...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Convincing guys to eat at a vegetarian restaurant is difficult, border-line impossible.  But, let me say that when I finally was able to convince them to come, they admit that even Wild Cow is a vegetarian restaurant that hungry male carnivores will enjoy.  I often find some vegan and vegetarian food bland or mild in taste.  But everything that I have ordered at Wild Cow is delicious and full of flavor.  Even their vegetables tossed in different sauces (I love the Miso Ginger) is a delicious side.  Their black bean burgers are moist and delicious and they have a bunch of options for devouring them in different styles.  The Philly cheesesteak is also remarkably scrumptious despite lacking any real meat!The only drawback? Maybe slightly unfriendly to those of us that do eat meat on a regular basis. The walls are lined with pictures of adorable animals staring back at you.  My friend said, \"I feel so guilty! It's like they know I eat meat!\"If you can get past that, then check out Wild Cow because the food is delicious and healthy.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Wild Cow is small and usually pretty crowded. I'm personally not a fan of the paint color or the rock wall decor, but hey, it has no bearing on the food. The staff is young, hip and friendly (I always love what they are wearing). We come to this place pretty often, so here is a round up of some of my favorite goodies off the menu. My personal favorite is the Far Eastland bowl. It's their take on Thai satay. It's a mixture of grilled tofu, kale, carrot slaw in a peanut sauce served over brown rice. I have never met a peanut sauce I didn't like and honestly, their tofu is pretty near perfect. It's just firm enough with a nice brown grill layer with all the flavor. The Veggie Quinoa bowl, the Far Eastland bowl's younger sister. Seasonal roasted veggies are served on top of quinoa with your choice of tempeh or tofu and covered in garlic aioli. I usually pick the tofu because I have never been a tempeh fan, even if it's done right. This is a good option if  you want to order something that isn't the Far Eastland bowl but don't want to venture THAT far outside your comfort zone. The Wild Cow has some nice vegetarian Mexican options. Their taco salad is pretty amazing, especially when you add the fajita seitan. This salad is REALLY big and that normally means leftovers for me. It is piled high with lettuce, rice, black beans, tortilla chips, homemade salsa and vegan sour cream. This is honestly one of my favorite salads in all of Nashville. Another one of their Mexican offerings is their sweet potato and black bean tacos. I usually add avocado and vegan sour cream to these. They are pretty tasty and quite filling. This dish comes with your choice of side and I always enjoy their chickpea salad in all it's creamy vegan glory.If you travel to Nashville and you don't eat meat- The Wild Cow will be on your itinerary, trust me.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So I've eaten here twice in the last two days and feel sufficiently introduced to write a review. Yesterday I had the vegan Cheesesteak and I have to say that although the seitan itself was incredible, the cheese that they use on it was no bueno and totally overwhelmed the seitan's flavor. It was so soaked through into the bread that I eventually gave up on the sandwich and forked out the seitan. They use Teese on this sandwich, seemingly the cheddar kind (which is also what they use for their queso), which is not the right kind of cheese anyway for a Philly Cheesesteak (need a white cheese). For my side, I got the sweet potato hash, which was tasty, although not what I expected. It has tons of curry flavor in it that overpowers the potato. Although I did like it, it was too strong to finish, and I don't think I would normally want a curry side to go with a sandwich. Yesterday, we were fortunate enough to get the last piece of cake, an Elvis number with chocolate, PB, and banana. It was one of the most amazing vegan cakes I've ever had. The best thing about it? (well, besides the fact that it was half priced and still moist after a day) It wasn't ridiculously sweet. It was the perfect combination of ingredients so that you didn't feel completely overwhelmed with sugar but could enjoy it from first bite to last. Today, we came back and I got the French Dip with an add-on of Daiya. This was quite good. I also sampled the burger and thought it was excellent, with a fresh-made bun and sprouts and avocado (California style). They only serve in-season veggies which meant that there were no tomatoes available, which is why I didn't order this myself today. I'll be back come summer. I ordered the spicy kale side and it was also excellent, though be warned: the garlic was so strong it could knock you out of your seat. The kale was cooked perfectly, but I wasn't able to finish the last of it, as I was overwhelmed with garlic-mouth. Note: this should be called Garlicky Kale.Companions got the chocolate chip cookie sandwich today and I thought it was just as successful as the dessert yesterday. Perfect amount of sweet without being overwhelming (even in the icing) and the cookie was wonderful. I asked about whether their baked goods are available special order, and the woman said that they are. If you ever need a vegan birthday cake, this is where you should go. All baked goods except the gluten-free offerings are baked there especially for Wild Cow. So overall, I was very happy with the offerings at Wild Cow, though I think everyone should know to ask further questions about the dishes, like what fake cheeses are used, and how the sides are prepared (and with what spices). I only wish they had another location in the West End or 21st area.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The service was generally good, but the surliness quotient went up when things got busy.Our first time we shared grilled seitan tacos, a blueberry lavender smoothie, and a market salad with grilled tofu. The portions were huge! The seitan was masterfully scorched and packed a salty punch amid the other fillings. I also ordered the french dip sandwich, which was less inspirational -- the wheat gluten did not feel quite right on the texture front; I would sub another protein there. The vegan ranch dressing on my side sald, however, was amazing.We came back again a bit late in the Monday lunch shift. Found a table, but our servers were scarce. The food took forever to come and was less good than our previous visit. The seitan tacos were less excellent -- seitan was under-scorched. My side of BBQ seitan was excellent though.Despite the slight letdown of the return visit, I would come back in a heartbeat -- especially when I need a break from the meat-heavy world of Nashville restaurants.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Also, coming from both southern California and seattle, theres a lot of vegan competition when it comes to restaurants. Im glad the staff werent all acting like they're gods and too hardcore for all these customers. Might be the south but still, I dig th warmth rather than the snobby cold shoulders haha.

I would have left a five star review just for the food alone, but every time I have dined there, I have a bad experience with rude staff (NOT talking about the owners). As a vegetarian, I'm used to non-vegetarians looking at me as the stereotyped, \"moody hipster\" ( though I'm much the opposite! Haha) just because of my food choices, but this place unfortunately lives up to the stereotype. I feel uncomfortable every time I eat there, and I'm a vegetarian!

I was shocked that she did not want to take the smoothie off the bill and wanted to debate it with me. She wanted to explain how their kitchen works. How did she even know the smoothie was made correctly?? Instead of offering to remake it, or make me something else, she just wanted to argue over $5. Really weird experience.

The portions and hearty and the cost is dirt-cheap! And the food is phenomenal! I have had to trick 2 of my biggest food-critic family members to get them there because of the whole \"vegetarian\" thing. Once they ate there.....they wanted to go back every weekend. Real, organic-tasting, raw food combinations with fabulous flavor. I highly recommend the Taco Sampler and the Veggie Quinoa Bowl. Everything that comes out of the kitchen looks nothing short of impressive(especially the Nachos appy). The wait can be long from time you order to getting on table, but you will have a full glass of water at all times and service is really great. Highly recommend.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I enjoyed the quinoa tacos with garlicky kale. I never knew there was vegan sour cream or that it would be a great topping! They have a good beer list to wash it all down too, but as the driver I stuck to organic green iced tea. It was fresh brewed and refreshing with no chemical aftertaste like so many restaurant teas.The service was friendly and helpful. At one point the owner checked in with us and engaged in friendly conversation. Prices were reasonable. I will probably add an extra side next trip to keep full, since I'm not normally a vegetarian.On weekend nights the restaurant is pretty busy, but we got in just before 7PM and were seated quickly - just before the rush.

The desserts are amazing.   All are vegan, and they offer raw and gluten-free desserts as well.  I am a sucker for their tall, beautiful layer cakes.  I can tell you that the mochacinno, rocky road, and almond joy cakes are wonderful.  The raw tiramisu is better than most \"normal\" tiramisus I've had.  They get all their desserts from Khan's Desserts.  The baker, Karina, is amazing and super reasonable with her prices.  I ordered a gluten free cherry cheesecake for my long-deprived Celiac boyfriend, and it was just $33 for a homemade, huge vegan cheesecake.  Our hotel didn't offer a fridge, so we kind of  ate the whole thing in...a day.  I might have eaten a few mochaccino cupcakes with it.ANYWAY.  Eat here.  Bring your skeptical friends.  Enjoy the laid back yet super efficient, professional service and delicious food.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The lentil stew was the JAM and the salad was fresh, crunchy and delish. I ate every bite.Then came my main course of the beans and greens. Garlicky kale with pinto beans over brown rice or quinoa (I went with rice) topped with garlic aioli. I liked this dish a lot but it was a not quite as hot as I would have liked so I boxed the majority of it up and requested dessert. They had quite the selection including a raw cheesecake that sounded great but I chose of a rosewater chocolate cupcake. It was both beautiful and tasty.So if you've seen Portlandia you prolly know \"put a bird on it'? I am a fan of taking it back a step (or forward a step depending on your chicken vs egg stance) and putting an egg on everything. When I warmed up my beans and greens today, I fried up a couple of sunny side up eggs to put over top of it. It was even better fully hot and with runny, delicious superfood on it. I wonder if I can request this next time? They had a great selection of beers as well as non-alcoholic beverages. I think I saw a local kombucha on the menu and I debated trying it out.Service was friendly, informative, and quick. I really enjoyed that they played The King of Carrot Flowers too. I love Neutral Milk Hotel and well this is a vegetarian restaurant and I love a little humor. Also, I am not a veggie and usually love to eat meat with my meals so I was happy that I found a flavorful place to try with my veggie friends or just when I am in the mood.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "A GOOD START TO BRINGING HEALTHY VEGETARIAN DINING TO NASHVILLE.I am impressed with Wild Cow. They offer an amazing rotating menu, daily specials, a plethora of Vegan desserts that are to die for, mostly at an amazing cost. Space is limited; as people pour in this non pretentious establishment, it can be a bit of a wait-but well worth it. Even as I write about it, I hesitate, because I don't want to wait 45 minutes for a meal in East Nashville or anywhere, but it is worth the wait. I have been there twice; Once for dinner, the other for a weekend brunch. Dinner meal was grilled tempeh with a spicy peanut sauce and veggies, followed by a piece of very expensive Tiramisu (my favorite). I would order it again despite the high price. I assume it is probably due to it being vegan (this can get pricey with ingredients plus the outsource their desserts). Still, I dream about that dinner.Weekend brunch I chose the special: Sweet Potato Pancakes with hash browns and iced green tea. I wasn't sold on the hash browns, but it was probably due to them not being covered in grease and butter. Basically, I got a healthy vegetarian brunch and I didn't have to cook. The staff is amazing. I had a friend that had to wait 45 minutes for dinner due to them being too busy and they comped her meal. She didn't expect it, but it goes to show this restaurant goes above and beyond for their customers, and still manage to have nights where they offer benefits for charity. The only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that I have experienced some amazing Vegetarian Restaurants that are a bit more skilled with their menus. But given this is Nashville, and they are a small establishment with excellent staff, I think we will see expansion eventually from this wonderful place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Overheard one employee, \"We don't have Coke, we have Cola, which has no high fructose corn syrup, we're a little biased here.\" Awesome, educating people about what they put in their body and serving only the purest ingredients.

We finally get a table and ordered some of the Vegan Queso & Salsa.  This came out fairly quick and was tasty.  Could not tell it was vegan.  Almost a nutty taste?My wife ordered the Taco Salad-Vegan.  I ordered the recommended Buffalo Beans & Greens.Her salad was more a little lettuce and a pile of beans, salsa, sour cream.  Very disappointed, though the flavor was great it was poorly presented and inedible.  Some tortilla chips would be a nice addition.  My entree, it was good.  I enjoyed it.  However, I could have easily gone to my fridge and whipped this up in 5 minutes.  Again, buffalo sauce and ranch were overpowering the dish.I would stop in and try something else next time.  Maybe our fault for ordering plain?  Maybe don't take recommendation from the servers?  Good place.  Good food.  Nothing to write home about.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've eaten at the Wild Cow as a regular menu order which I give 3 stars and at the new Tuesday night buffet which I give 5 stars for a grand total of 4, right?!First visit I ordered the nacho cheez dip and chips. Ugh, vegan cheez - I dont think its WIld Cow's fault but that stuff is just.not.right. Vegans do yourself a favor and just don't call anything even remotely near the word 'cheese' even with a cute spelling mmmkay? You will save us omnivores and vegetarians a LOT of heartache. Anyway - not their fault, but the chips were kinda bland-ola too. My entree of the BBQ seitan sandwich was very well executed and the kale was great, although as Simon below mentions, I hope you like garlic! The service was 'chill' - I think that sums it up pretty well. I really really dig the ambiance, its not too 'hippy dippy' so you can bring your parents or NRA friends along without any awkwardness, but its also bright and cheerful with pictures of animal lives you're saving on the wall ;D Very casual!Onto the star of the Wild Cow - the new Tuesday night buffet! For a pocketbook friendly $10 you get access to a little hot bar of approximately 2 veggies proteins (tofu and tempeh the night I was there) 4 veggies, 2 starches (cous cous and 'special' rice), kale salad, tortillas, chili/soup and a variety of yummy vegan sauces (lemon maple beet and hummus). Since it would take me a novela to write a review of each dish suffice it to say I think I gained 5lbs on health food people! Its a good thing they ran out of vegan cupcakes or I might have gained 10. The place was packed on the inaugural buffet night but the employee's were really hustling (yes! Hippies were actually hustling it was CRAZY!! *I kid...) and it was flowing fairly well and quickly, but if you aren't a flexible 'go with the flow' kind of person I'd recommend getting there early (its 4-9pm) or the notebook paper wait list and table sharing might wig you out ;)Summary? Vegans, veggo's, omnivores, locavores, carnivores and junk food junkies - please go try this out! You will surprise yourself on how truly fantastic these people whip up some veggie matter! The only thing is - I think they need my husbands veggie chili recipe ;) His whoops theirs any day! ha!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Had lunch one day and it was pretty damn great. Decide to stop for a quick breakfast on the way to the airport on our last day there (a Sunday). Place was busy, so we told the server we were trying to catch a flight, etc. She got the order out pretty quickly, and we were out of there. Would definitely go back. Place is absolutely on par with vegan restaurants in this price range in NYC, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, etc. A great surprise.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Lauderdale, FL), the high end (Millennium in San Francisco) to the lick-your-plate-clean delicious, every day food at Chicago Diner.  I've also eaten at some terrible vegetarian restaurants that I won't mention even though most of them have closed.  To me, Wild Cow's food sits squarely in the middle of the pack of all the vegetarian restaurants I've tried and at the top of the pack when it comes to Nashville options.  My favorite dishes are the Beans & Greens Buffalo style, the Nachos appetizer, Taco Salad, the Buffalo Grinder, and one of their new dishes - the Far Eastland Bowl.  My favorite sides are the spicy kale and the grilled veggies with peanut sauce or garlic aioli.  They also have really good specials some times too. I've tried the new buffet on Tuesday nights and really enjoyed it both times. I just wish they were open for brunch.  I'm dying to get some vegan pancakes or french toast in this city!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Being a Vegetarian is definitely doable if there were more restaurants like this one out there.  I only have one gripe.  What's with the identity crisis?  Vegan Steak and cheese?  It's tasty enough that it doesn't need to emulate a cow.  Would cutting my pork chop in the shape of banana or squash make it taste any different?  Naming these Vegan entrees after popular meat dishes forces the customer to make an unnecessary comparison.  In a way, the concept is the same as eating a Drag Queen (yeah I kinda regret writing that cuz it's gross, but it illustrates the point so well).Dear Wild Cow,Your food is yummy.  Halloween is over, please stop dressing up your food as something else.  Your spicy kale is delicious however it should be renamed as kale-esque garlic.  It's garlic strong, vampires beware.Your atmosphere is very comfortable, laid back, and welcoming of those who where tie-dyed clothing... Republicans beware.Thank you for serving the community.Respectfully yours,- Salty Boy\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I like that Nashville finally has a hippy-dippy, Kombucha-serving, vegan bakery and seitan-full restaurant to put in its repertoire. It's nice that Southern vegans can finally come out of hiding and no one at Wild Cow will beat them with fried chicken. As much as I think Nashville needs a Wild Cow, that still doesn't change the fact that my food was mediocre.If you don't like garlic, you can order dessert. There's not really a menu item that doesn't rely heavily on garlic-y, onion-y flavor. If you're not in the mood for highly processed and/or glutentastic faux-meat, you're down to a few options. I try to avoid a soy-centric diet, so I opted for the sweet potato and black bean tacos. They weren't anything special. Satisfactory, but I'm pretty sure most of us veggie-noshers know how to prepare a good chunk of the Cow's menu ourselves, and do so regularly, at home. I also tried the nachos, which were undeniably tasty, but what dish full of highly processed, unhealthy, animal product substitutes isn't sinfully delicious? The heaps of vegan sour cream, seitan, and Daiya on chips were too much for me... but in a good way. After dinner, I regretted filling up on average-Joe vegetarian food, because the bakery options are pretty extensive and 100% vegan. The raw mango cheesecake, grasshopper cake, and the German chocolate cupcakes all caught my eye, and I'm not going to be whipping up any of that in my own kitchen any time soon. I stuck with a Kombucha, though, which they have a pretty solid selection of (six kinds) and my stomach was grateful. Would I go back? Yes, if I'm craving that fatty slice of grasshopper cake or something else that'll probably give me diabetes. Although, it's all vegan... so... that means I can have both, right? Right. ***OH WAIT, never mind! The owner attempted to fooducate me via Yelp messages on why everything at Happy Cow is actually healthy and I had to get all nutrition technical on her, so now I'm somewhere between \"A-OK\" and \"Eek! Methinks not.\" Leaning towards the latter.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

That was some good stuff and turns your breath into a lethal weapon.  No kisses after that stuff.So, all-in-all this place has really come a long way.  Not the bland, flavor-fearful hangout it used to be, but certainly not a place that I would clamor for (especially with Silly Goose, Jeni's Ice Cream, Rosepepper and Eastland Cafe within spitting distance.  I hereby remove this establishment from the \"List of Places That Suck\".\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Got a peanut butter kale smoothie and fell in love with it. The buffalo tempeh strips were very well made and just the right amount for two to share for an appetizer. I got the French dip tempeh sandwich which was great but I ended up jealous over the seitan tacos that my lunch mate got. The atmosphere was really cool and the staff was lively and nothing but smiles. If you're into pro-animal rights vegan spots, this place does it extremely well. Huge portions.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I digress, however walking through the door of The Wild Cow is like time traveling back to 1978. The food is delicious, in a horribly fattening, crunchy, earthy, Woodstock-y kind of way. Enormous bowls of lentils, beans, brown rice, garlicky kale; tacos overstuffed with delicious things, wrapped with double layers of thick, doughy white tortillas. It is all tasty, cheap and very, very heavy. This is stodgy, filling, old school vegetarian food. The decor is a throwback to another era, and everyone in there looks like a student, with beanies, tattoos and piercings everywhere you look. Pleasant service, but vegetarian food has evolved so much since the seventies, with clean green food, it was a surprise to find something so...charmingly retro. Great if you're young, hungry, and on a budget. For a more sophisticated, elegant palate, try Avo.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

As such, it pains me to say that my service this past Friday was poor and insulting.My Mom was visiting from out of town and I took her to Wild Cow as she co-owns a Health Food store and I thought she might enjoy it.  We repeatedly told the waiter \"Tempeh - not Tofu\" when ordering.  But as you might guess, we got tofu anyway.  This was not a deal breaker, mistakes get made.  A young lady that had been seating people took over our table.  She asked my 12 year old daughter if she was finished with her food(she had eaten about half of her bowl). My daughter responded \"Yes, I am stuffed\"  The young lady rolled her eyes at my daughter and let out a dramatic sigh as she took my child's bowl.When it was time to pay the check, my Mom and I argued over her paying her own check.  I signaled to the young lady that took over our table - not to listen to my Mom.The young lady did not understand my signal, again, this is fine.  What I really found inappropriate was her reaction.  Instead of politely letting me know that she didn't understand, she took a condescending tone and said \"Now I don't know what to do! I don't know what THIS (insert hand signal) means.\".I go to restaurants for the food but will leave or stay for the service.  It makes me sad that I will probably never have the beans and greens from Wild Cow again.  Customer Service DOES matter.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My dad got the pork chop, I got the herb chicken skillet, boyfriend got a Caesar salad with blackened chicken, my sister got the pasta dish with vodka sauce, and my mom got paella. Now, my mom is from Colombia so she's used to very good paella. This one was soupier than normal and did not have much rice, but the broth was very good and she loved the mussels. My sister's pasta sauce was delicious... I kept eating off of hers. My herbed chicken was very good, though it did say it came with jalapeño mac and cheese and I did not detect any jalapeños.. oh well! My dad was in love with his pork chop. I tried it, and it had a wonderful char-like flavor. Definitely the best choice at the table. The service was a little slow towards the end (it was about 9:30 and they closed at 10:00 so they were cleaning and what not) but we didn't feel rushed.

    "comments": "The food at Yellow Porch is good-- but I was left overall with a bad taste in my mouth due to the service. My sister, her friend and I made a reservation on a Saturday night. We chose YP exactly because they take reservations-- we had a housewarming party to attend after dinner and wanted to make it on time. When we checked in, the host seemed scattered. He told us that our table was being cleared and set up... which was an odd thing to say as it's a small restaurant, and it became apparent real quick that the previous diners were lingering a little too long over their meal. We watched table after table get seated before us (which OK, I get it, they book reservations according to how many people are in the party). We then heard a server ask a host if all the people in our time slot had been seated-- and her told her they had. Finally she comes back over (we'd been waiting 35 minutes past our reservation time) and they discuss what to do with us, as apparently there was a booth being held open for a VIP diner to come in. As they were discussing, our table finally gets up and we're able to be seated. It was a bit maddening as the booth sat open for another 45 minutes before the diner arrived. Our server apologizes and we get to the eating/drinking part, which was honestly good (we had the fritters, lasagna, vodka penne, and the roast chicken). But the food was overshadowed by the overall poor service experience. I didn't feel entitled to special treatment, but we were all surprised that we weren't offered a complimentary appetizer/dessert or even a drop by from the manager. We're 3 young women, so not the usual high-rollers, but we enjoy dining out and always tip well. I don't think it will be my choice to return to YP any time soon.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I really wanted to love The Yellow Porch. I love that its close to work and its really a cute and quaint place. However, there are definitely some room for improvement. The parking lot is tiny, and it's tough getting in-and-out, there is a 'parking attendant' that guides you on where to park and directs you to an overflow at the hotel behind the restaurant. We probably did go at the worst time, noon on a Friday afternoon. They do not seat you until your entire party is in the building.  While waiting in the very small host area, the hostess/server seemed agitated with us, but we let that slide.  15 minutes later, we seated. We were offered bread, which I believe is the Tuscan bread Provence, with an olive oil/balsamic dip. For a starter, I had their tomato soup. The flavor was good, it was sweet with just a bit of tartness, but lacked a richness and texture. For my entree, I had the turkey club with a side of quinoa salad, both were just ok. Nothing that made me wanna slap my mama. I did get to try their veggie chips, and they were good, crispy and lightly salted. The server was nice; however, it took quite a long time for our food to come out. From sit down to standing up, we were there for an hour and a half, not including wait time. Would like to give it another try, perhaps a different entree at a different hour and day.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We let our waitress know and she was very apologetic and recommended a retire of the same dish and it would be comp'd.  We opted for the wild rice soup which was great.  We wish the soup portions were a little bigger because they definitely are worth the drive.  It will probably be a few months before we come back but we will come back since the food is good.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The black bean burger was fantastic; I love the texture of the burger, it was unlike any that I've had before, and I have eaten a lot of black bean burgers people. I also got a side of potato salad that was delicious and some greens for heath reasons.

    "comments": "We happened upon this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation. And the Yelp reviews led me to believe this would be a place I would select when traveling for work solo. Our party of 6 was seated promptly. Water was served and we were given the drink menu by the server. After a few minutes, she came back to take drinks orders. She seemed a bit in a hurry. We also ordered a few appetizers. After she walked away, we decided to add one more and she seemed annoyed. From here, things were just ok. I am not sure if she thought we were trying to be \"that table\" or what. It was a business dinner with a variety of people at the table with different dietary needs. She wasn't even that helpful when asking questions about items on the menu. We finally placed our orders and the appetizers arrived. We had quite a few, the charcuterie, salmon flatbread,  dumplings and one other that escapes me as I write this review. Everyone enjoyed the appetizers. Several of us also ordered salads to start with and they arrived shortly after the appetizers. I had Port Poached sun dried cherry salad. It was really good. The cherries paired well with the goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. My entree was the Coffee Brined Smoked Pork Chop. First of all it was huge!  Served with haricot vert (green beans), hash browns and pineapple chutney. I am not doing justice to the the description of the sides.....the pork chop was a bit dry and honestly hard to cut with a knife. While it had nice flavor, it was just a bit overcooked. Others at the table seemed to enjoy their entrees. Several got the chicken and the other 2 got salads. Would I return, probably not as there are a ton of restaurants to try in Nashville but I can see that this place is very popular and we may have just caught them on a bad night. It happens but I think a place like this probability really prides themselves on the food the kitchen puts out and I think they missed on the pork chop and the service was a bit off.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The hostess kept saying she couldn't rush the people who were already seated, which I totally understand. However, this is always a problem with this restaurant and they should know how to work a reservation/seating system by now.Bottom line: If you are okay with extremely slow service and a pointless reservations system, the food will satisfy you.Parking - the lot is small and you will likely end up parking next door at the bank.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Last week we dined at Yellow Porch for Nashville Restaurant Week 2015. I had the opportunity to attend twice. First with my husband and two close friends of ours, we had a great time sitting out on the porch. We first arrived and didn't get drinks for about 10-15 mins. The menus had too many choices. They had the main menu (everyday menu), the restaurant week menu, and the a specials menu, totally 3 menus..a bit much in my opinion. Aside from somewhat decent service, I decided on the cheddar fritters with a chow chow for my app and the salmon dish for my main dish. I was very pleased with both. They had wonderful flavors! My husband orders the dumplings to start and then the spare ribs for his main dish, he was pleased as well. My next visit was Sat night and our sevice was much better but my fish was horrible. I got the Trout stuffed with crab and shrimp, I am pretty positive my trout had been flattened to death, over cooked and had bread crumbs as the stuffing ( didn't have any crab or shrimp inside ). This dish was so fishy I couldn't finish it. The sauce tasted like straight up fishy dish water, sorry! I won't let this one experience ruin Yellow Porch for me but it will not be ordering the Trout ever again there.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Overall: Vegetarian & vegan food that will please even the most staunch carnivores.Food: If you're scared of tempeh, TVP, tofu or seitan you have 2 options... saddle up and try it, or go somewhere else. I recommend trying it out! The black bean & sweet potato tacos with jerk seasoning and cabbage is divine. It definitely has a spicy pop, but not overpowering. A friend ordered the buffalo grinder w/ tempeh and inhaled the entire thing before I could get a taste! Another friend ordered the special, sloppy joes w/ TVP and it tasted pretty darn great. The spices were powerful, so fair warning, but I would probably order that next time if it were available.Service: There are only a couple waitresses, but it's a small place so it worked out fine. They're happy to answer any questions you have about menu items you may not be familiar with.Cost: SUPER affordable. My tacos (which were so large I couldn't finish 2!) including tip (20%) was $11.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "As everyone in Nashville knows, this city does not have very many vegetarian/vegan restaurants in town. I do like this place and the feel as well. There isn't much seating there though; it's quite small. The first time I went in there it was during the evening on a Friday, and it was pretty packed. My friend and I took our time deciding what to eat as we waited for a table. The second time, I went by myself around 1pm midweek, and it was really dead.Now onto the food. I enjoy eating the food. It's been a while since I've been there. The first time I had a salad and it was the full size. And it was Huge! I didn't finish it. The next time I ordered the Rice and Beans, I believe, and that was really tasty. Both these meals had a lot of flavor! They also have vegan desserts which looked yummy. They serve alcohol and have 3 flavors of tea that they brew in-house! :)Cons: Service was alright. The first time I went the tables were sticky, but we just moved to another table as soon as it was free and clear of plates.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

If I could eat here all the time (and if my man wasn't such a great cook who never skimps on the meat), I could easily go back to my old vegetarian ways.  The flavors in everything I've tried here are amazing!  Even when I was a vegetarian, I rarely found a veggie burger I liked..  but I am completely hooked on their veggie burgers and actually crave them.  You can get them many different ways--rueben style, animal style (think In-n-Out Burger), California style (w/ avocado), buffalo style, and more.  Included along with their pretty diverse menu are daily specials.  I tried pizza tacos (or something along those lines) a few weeks ago and was truly amazed at how good vegan sour cream could taste.  The tacos were completely delicious and satisfying and surprisingly 100% vegan.They also serve high octane beer, sangria, and more.  Wednesday is Wild Wednesday which means happy hour all day.  During lunch, parking can sometimes be a challenge as the entire Waldon development this is in has become so popular.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

To be able to go into a restaurant and choose anything off the menu is what I'm assuming heaven would be like.I enjoyed a vegan ruben and lentil stew. The ruben doesn't compare to an actual meat ruben that i remember from so long ago when I ate meat, but it by no means took away from the sandwich. It was excellent. If this place existed in Indy, I would have a hard time not eating there constantly. Great selection too. Lots to choose from. I'm a sucker for quirky things, so the framed pictures of random animals on the wall did it for me. My favorites were the squirrel and goat. Each table as a placard showing and describing a local pet that is available for adoption. The only actual thing I found that wasn't pretty much perfect was the fact that I had to eat my lentil stew with a fork. A spoon wasn't given by default and honestly, I was too lazy to ask for a spoon (so it's mostly my own fault).\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I just moved to Nashville and am currently residing on my friends couch in East Nashville so I decided to walk around the neighborhood and I stumbled upon this amazing gem of a restaurant. Everything they serve is either vegetarian or vegan (they also have a gluten free menu) and they buy almost everything in its whole form so all the sauces, dressings, stocks, soups, etc. are made in house. They also support a lot of local charities and actually have a card you can get through them that donates 4% of your purchase to a charity of your choice. Just make sure you ask for a card when you go in there and then you will be able to choose from a list, a charity that you would like to support. Pretty awesome! Now on to the food. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and on this particular day I was craving Mexican so I decided to go with the Quinoa tacos and a small side salad. The green goddess dressing on my salad was yum yum yum and I really liked how they served sprouts on the salad. The tacos were very tasty. I highly enjoyed all the tastes that entered my mouth with each bite, especially the citrus like green salsa with the pinto beans and sour cream. I was pretty full after this but the cupcakes on the counter were really calling my name so I decided to get the lavender vanilla cupcake to go. Boy am I glad I did!They also have daily specials that you can look at online if you want to know them before you go.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

What first struck me was the variety of items they had on their menu and also the attentive service they provide.Although it was a hard decision, I decided on the French Quarter Dip (grilled mushrooms, seitan, and onions on a hoagie with au jus dipping sauce). It was piping hot when the server brought it to me. I thought it was OK, but I tasted way too much sage seasoning. The sweet potato hash was fine as well, though tasted a little burnt. Next time I will definitely get something else because I have a feeling that this is not their best dish.I also ordered a shot of wheatgrass, which was fresh and lovely. To top the meal off, I had a slice of the cookies 'n cream cake. It was delicious but so big!! If you order a slice of cake, try to do it when you are eating with someone who won't mind sharing with you. I was going solo on this trip and it was a lot of food.

However, I never tasted a bite of their food as I was promptly seated and left sitting with the menu in front of my face for 20 minutes. The place was not crowded but my waiter had a party of 8 come in after me and took their drink order before me and continued to ignore me despite me waiving her down. She then proceeded to take their order before mine, even though I had arrived 5 minutes prior and she had not taken my drink order yet. I laid $2 on the table for the fountain tea I eventually served myself and left without ever being waited on after 20 minutes. On a positive note the menu looked delicious I just never had a chance to experience the food thanks to the horrible service.

We were there at lunchtime on a warm and sunny Saturday when the place was full, but we were seated very quickly by a pretty nice guy (quiet, but when I asked about stores in the area he was very friendly).My companion had the fajitas tacos (and I was only able to get a bite before he destroyed it) - delicious, spicy green salsa, and the tempeh looked good too. My Prince Fielder sandwich was really wonderful - I loved the bite-y spicy mustard. I also had a side of sweet potato hash which, while good, was not quite as flavorful as I hoped. We also split a Yazoo Sue off of their \"High Alchohol Beer\" list (it was 12:30 in Nashville, which was 1:30 in Columbus, which is almost a respectable time to drink 9.0% alcohol beers, right?).

    "comments": "The Wild Cow offers an array of delicious vegetarian vegan, and GF delights from artichoke dip, organic quinoa veggie bowls,  and buffalo \"cheesesteaks,\" to gluten-free chocolate cake and incredible raw cake selections.  Art and I were in Nashville for a getaway and thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this establishment.  After an inadvertent shove from a busy Silly Goose, we hopped next door to this lovely place and got right in on Friday night.   Friendly service and incredible, house-made options made the visit worthwhile.  We started with tort chips and a very fresh green salsa, and Art had the quinoa-veggie bowl while I had the veggie burger \"picnic style\" (house-made pineapple slaw and organic BBQ).  Delish.  I loved the option of hemp milk on the menu, but sadly they were all out.  I happily accepted the substitution of organic soy.  Having never indulged in a raw cake, I had to try the blueberry lemon.  It was smooth, cool and tangy and well worth the $7.  Hard to believe it's made from nuts!   Although we didn't try any, there were some tasty-sounding, fresh juice concoctions on the menu too.I only eat organic meat, so I love a good veggie-vegan place.  I'm also not one for meat substitutes, but the Wild Cow offers organic tempeh and tofu - so no yucky GMOs.  Non-meaters please enjoy all the \"cheesesteaks,\" \"Reubens,\" and \"french dips\" you wish!A+ Wild Cow!  The ironic name is appreciated as well...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I don't know how they make their cheese for the nachos, but I crave those nachos all the time! The tacos are all very good too. I've yet to have anything that I didn't like.

I've heard a few people complain about the amount of food you get for the price, but I don't think those people are aware of how pricey vegan ingredients can be!Service is excellent. The staff is knowledgable, especially when it comes to GF options.  Melanie remembers my name every time I come in, which definitely earns some bonus points. My to go orders are always ready within 10-15 minutes, even when the restaurant is busy.They have a small, well-selected variety of high alcohol beers, and the burger and beer night ($10, I think?) is a great deal.I should probably just go on and direct deposit part of my paycheck here.

    "comments": "On a recent trip to Nashville with vegetarian friends, we hit up Wild Cow for lunch on July 4th. I'm from \"up North,\" where every the number of vegetarian restaurants is directly correlated to the college populace that supports them. I'm not a vegetarian myself, but I heartily appreciate tasteful vegetarian dishes and I'm certainly not opposed to all green fare. Wild Cow is located in what seems to be a renovated industrial space; high ceilings, etc. The air conditioning was chuggin', keeping the place just kinda uncomfortably \"warm-ish\" at best... but to be fair it was about 106 F outside that day. The waitress took our name, nodded and walked away... no indication of the wait. A half hour later we were seated. The menu is cool but as another reviewer said, the options rely heavily on processed vegan/vegetarian foods as well as garlic and onion flavors. Garlic is my thing so I opted for the beans & greens dish- basically sauteed kale and beans with a creamy white sauce. (At the time of writing this review, it's the featured photo.) It was actually quite delicious and filling... and after a brief survey of my friend's dishes I decided I had the best plate. The watermelon mint juice was disappointing, both in taste and presentation. I'm not sure what I was hoping for, but  it wasn't a little mini solo cup of mediocre \"fresh juice.\"  They have lots of sides to chose from and a fridge full of Kombucha. I thought the prices on the menu were really good. All in all, not a bad spot for some veg fare.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They have a wide variety of vegan comfort foods, but also have a ton of very creative meal options that are both delicious and nutritious. I am pretty sure everything on the menu is amazing, but I definitely recommend trying their chickpea salad.

I never expected Wild Cow in East Nashville to send me back to my childhood.Vegetarian food and true southern cooking don't seem to go together, but they do in Nashville. By far, no lie, I had the tastiest tacos today. The special was Baja-style tempeh tacos with a pineapple cole slaw, avocado, radishes and fresh cilantro in soft corn tortillas. For my side, I chose collard greens.Fabulous! Every bite! After, I split a \"cream cheese\" swirl brownie. Not sure what it was, but it tasted like the real deal, moist, creamy, exceptional.

We heard about the Wild Cow and decided to try it. IT WAS GREAT! I had the Philly \"Cheese steak\" and my husband had the sweet potato tacos. Both were delicious. I would have given it five stars except he only got 2 small tacos, *edit* I think a full meal should be three. although i didn't note earlier that it does come with rice and beans so it just depends on how much you eat i guess. Also, my sandwich was a nice size ( i checked my receipt and they didn't charge me for that side... so it does come with a side (sorry about that in the first review)* I decided to get the spicy kale that everyone should try (its not spicy as it hot) just spicy as in flavorful.

Who couldn't fall in love with that name?I am a proudly-declared fresh food and vegetable lover not a vegetarian nor a vegan so I wasn't quite so sure what to expect. My fellow carnivore and I headed in and was immediately greeted by the folks behind the counter. Wild Cow doesn't exactly have a system in terms of seating or getting your menu. You kind of grab a menu, order at the counter, and then they bring out your food. Onto the food. The food was quite yummy. I selected a light option and partook of the dill hummus plate ($5) which was seemingly freshly ground, however, I would have enjoyed a bit more flavor. It came with an array of sliced vegetables and chips. The taco salad ($8.25) was also ordered and from the time the server set the plate down in front of him, it was nearly gone. Clean plate award!!!!Overall, the Wild Cow has a lot to offer and I will be making my way back around these parts again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Though, not to worry - meals are both plentiful and quite reasonable. If you are looking for a new healthy home away from home, you've found it. Thanks to manager Melanie, to Taylor, our waitress, and to Charlie, our server. You gave us the best dining experience! Taylor is so nice and helpful - they all work as a seamless team. Kudos and thanks to the owner and chef. We are grateful!In case inquiring minds, etc... we  had the Far Eastern Bowl with organic quinoa (I added portobello mushroom, grilled onions (the onions are not usually on the menu but they graciously accommodated my request) and avocado on the side. It comes with garlicky kale, grilled tofu, peanut sauce, and other goodies...and it was sublime. My child had the black bean California veggie burger with homemade vegan ranch dressing on whole wheat bun. We asked for the pickles on the side and extra lettuce instead of sprouts and once again - easy.  This comes with a choice of sides and the lentil stew was outstanding. The burger was so good, she wanted another one for dinner! The piece de resistance was the vegan vanilla chocolate chip cake for dessert. And fyi, don't miss the raspberry herb ice-tea. It's so refreshing.Run, don't walk. We can't wait to return!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Towards the end of our meal, people kept trickling in so I'm glad we got there early and were seated right away. We ordered the tomato basil soup, Mediterranean chicken salad, roast beef sandwich, and celery blue cheese soup. We really loved the food. My fiance had the sandwich/celery blue cheese soup and cleaned his plate. The tomato basil soup tasted really fresh, could have used a bit more basil though. I wasn't that impressed with the salad. It was smothered in vinaigrette & it seemed that they just opened a can of Kalamata olives and dumped the entire can on the salad. Would have love to have had less olives/vinaigrette  and maybe some more veggies in the salad.Overall, the food was good and reasonably priced.

    "comments": "The Yellow Porch has a really great atmosphere, which makes a delicious meal even more enjoyable. I loved their contemporary artwork, which includes paintings of random celebrities (like Adam Levine for some reason). The dining room is small and cozy, as well as a nice outdoor porch which is disappointingly not yellow. Due to the rain, things were pretty much limited to interior seating. I saw several people waiting quite a while for a table, so I'm glad we had the foresight to get reservations.We started off with the Sweetwater Tennessee Sharp Cheddar Fritters, which come with a spicy aioli and chow chow. They were amazing! Slightly sweet and slightly spicy at the same time. I loved the crunch of the chow chow, and the vinegar paired nicely with the gooey white cheddar. This was a great appetizer.Choosing an entree was rather difficult, because everything sounded awesome. I finally settled on the Coffee Brined Smoked Pork Chop, complete with hash-browned potatoes with chorizo and poblano peppers, haricot vert (aka green beans), and some combination of a orange-scented achiote cilantro sauce and a pineapple chutney.The hash was fantastic. The chorizo added a great sweetness and wasn't overly greasy, plus the milder poblanos added some nice flavors as well. The green beans were cooked very well, and they had thankfully soaked up some of the smokiness. My pork chop was deliciously smoky! It was also very tender and juicy, with a nice seasoning and an even better sear. There was definitely a good kick from the peppers here. I didn't really taste any coffee, but everything I could taste was spectacular.For dessert, we split the Chocolate Espresso Torte. It was dense and chocolatey and phenomenal. The torte wasn't overpoweringly sweet, which I liked, and there was just the right amount of espresso to add flavor without being too bitter. This was the perfect end to our meal.I was really impressed with The Yellow Porch, and we will definitely be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The food is mostly good: cheddar fritters are yummy, blood orange martini is recommended, lamb chops (hubby said were good) but the shrimp and crab stuffed trout was disappointing. The piece of trout was kind of small and the shrimp and crab was formed into some kind of cake and shoved between the split fillet. The bed of grits it sat on we're quite tasty and I'm not even much of a fan of grits. The service...Eric....terrible! The parking lot attendant and the hostess were friendly but our server seemed very annoyed to have to be there. Numerous times when we thanked him for bringing something he replied with a barely audible \"mmhmm\". Not impressed with him at all. Overall an unimpressive experience. I want a \"nice dinner night\" do-over!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Two of us ordered the New York Strip from the specials menu (without a price listed) and one ordered the scallops and grouper.  Both steaks were ordered medium and were served extra well done, so were sent back. The redo's were better cooked but the steak was bland. The scallops and grouper turned out to be a single scallop and a very small portion of grouper-maybe 2 oz at best. $38 per steak and $28 for the single scallop and grouper. Very disappointing.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Yelp reviews (and proximity) lead my wife and I to begin our date night of dinner and the theater at Yellow Porch. We were there for approximately 10 minutes. Other than the kind man that let us in the door, our entire experience was negative. To say we were \"greeted\" by the hostess would be a massive overstatement. She didn't welcome us or give any indication that she appreciated us being there. As we stood in front of her hostess stand my wife had to say \"There's just two of us\" to break the awkward silence. Her response was, \"You don't have a reservation?\" Imagine it in the snootiest of tones. Glancing around the utterly empty restaurant (one table had guests seated), we said \"No\". I think I discerned a \"Follow Me\" as she scooped up a couple menus and headed across the somewhat poorly appointed dining room. We were led to a small table for two the had a chair at one end and a wall bench with pillows at the other. Both were marginally comfortable at best. The wine list and Specials menu were set upon the table along with the regular menus. No mention was given to either. By the hostess nor our future waiter. Not a minute went by before we were joined by a, presumably, friendlier gentleman. He brought water and was cordial. I believe he was the bartender. We noticed one thing immediately. The room was chili and our particular location, beneath an air vent, was frigid. I was in long sleeves and my wife wore a sweater. No matter. The air cut through us like a knife. When our waiter returned, my wife ordered hot coffee and I, recognizing that seating location was going to ruin any opportunity to enjoy our meal, apologized to our waiter for the inconvenience and kindly asked to transfer to another table. I even mentioned that I realized that it may mess up the seating order or his section and that I was truly sorry for that. His response was a curt ,\"I can't make any guarantee that it'll be any better, but let me see.\" Encouraging, I know. A minute later he helped us relocate to another table. Presumably out of his section. I don't know how it is even possible, but this table location was more uncomfortable and colder than the first. We decided after sitting for a minute or two that we were going to bring our brief relationship with the Yellow Porch to an end. We pulled out a couple dollars and placed it on the table. Call it an inconvenience fee. About this time a new waitress approached. We let her know we were going. She was rude and went on to the next table. As we got up, I heard that table ask if they could sit outside because it was so cold. I hope their experience was better than ours.The food might be good. Could be the best in town. But I will never know. I do know, however, that right around the corner at Monell's I was greeted with a smile and southern American cuisine that hit the spot. Our date night, even with the bumpy start, was a complete success. No thanks to Yellow Porch.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I went to the Yellow Porch as a few people recommended it to me. Plus they were participating in restaurant week here in Nashville which means you can try an appetizer, main entree or dessert for only $30 or $40 (depending on the entree). Upon arriving at the restaurant you'll fish that, like every other place in Nashville, there is not nearly enough parking. Seriously this city needs to do something about the parking and traffic situation here. It is awful. However they do have someone in the lot who helps you find a space or advises you to park at the bank next store which we did and that was fine since it's a really short walk. We had a reservation so were greeted right away and seated immediately. The restaurant is small so I would definitely recommend a reservation. We got there at 6 and it wasn't too busy but when we were leaving there was a big line waiting for tables. I thought that the food was very good. I had the spinach and watermelon salad for my appetizer, the salmon for my entree and carrot cake for dessert. Our server wasn't the friendliest person I've ever met but she was knowledgable about the menu and everything came out quickly and drinks were always refilled without us having to ask. I would definitely return and highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a cute, unique and intimate dining experience in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Disappointing dinner - we went back to the Yellow Porch after receiving a gift certificate from Nashville Originals. We had not been there for dinner since our third date - about seven years ago. I remember The Yellow Porch always being consistently strong, but had not been there in a while since there are so many other great places to try. Service was fairly attentive, but odd. We were seated by the bar (the restaurant is small and really just a big room, so the bar is not very separate). The tables were packed together so tightly it was hard to navigate to and from the table, so it proved challenging for both the waitress (and me when I went to the bathroom). We were seated at a 4 top, but if we could not have actually fit 4 people at the table. It seemed like the bartenders were serving our tables - which made them somewhat erratic. They appeared stressed and perhaps overstretched.The salad was great (the same one they have had for a decade -  it is a yummy dried cherry salad). But, the entrees were disappointing to say the least. I got the filet and asked for it medium. It came rare and I had to send it back (the waitress even commented that it was \"very rare\"). My husband had the  NY Strip special and his steak was also served very rare (he wanted medium rare), but he decided it was fine - he tends to never send things back. But, the steak was so chewy and tough he did not even finish it - something rare for him! The sides that came with each meal were ok - mine were better than my husbands. My dessert was so-so. I got the the tiramisu and it was dry and disappointing.  My husband's creme brulee was yummy and he said the coffee was outstanding! Drinks were good. All in all - dinner was pretty expensive for two people ($165 with tip and 2 drinks) for the experience. It seems like Yellow Porch has fallen to the \"B\" team. With so many great choices in Nashville, we will probably not be back...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Taco salad, fajita style, is always an excellent choice and make sure you get it with vegan queso...so good. Buffalo grinder is also a great stand by. Tonight's special was Hawaiian Taco's...seitan curls with slaw and pineapple salsa with a chipotle sauce...absolutely delicious. Place can get crowded sometimes and food may take awhile to get to your table but always worth the wait.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They do vegetarian in a unique and tasty way, and have a wide amount of healthy options. We've enjoyed the Lentil Stew with the addictive garlic aioli, and the Veggie burger, which is unlike any I've ever had in the best way. Also the garlicky kale makes me enjoy kale, which even Whole Foods had failed to do.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

In classic newlywed style, we shared the following: the philly, a zucchini soup, lentil soup, spinach dip and the sweet potato black bean tacos. Everything was fresh, original and masterfully seasoned, but the tacos particularly  impressed me. My groom was particularly taken with the philly, as he is a great enthusiast of the omnivorous version of the sandwich and seitan. I liked it also, but couldn't get over the tacos, despite being seitan crazy myself. Our server was possibly the nicest guy ever and additionally very prompt and attentive. We're dog people and enjoyed the dog photos. I found the meal romantic and it was a great way to end our getaway.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My first choice was the French Dip (to which I added Daiya mozzarella) and it was reaaaally good. I love the way they cook their seitan in thin slices, which gives the whole thing a great texture. I got to try the Philly Cheesesteak as well, but the sauce wasn't very reminiscent of the standard Philly cheese I've had before, so I think it would have been better with just Daiya instead.The next time we came I got the Cali-style burger with Daiya added and it was fantastic(it had ranch dressing and avocado, mmmm). The dill cauliflower-carrot veggie of the day was OK, but needed a little salt. Both of the cakes we tried were amazing, and the last one was called the \"Cookie Monster Cake\". The thing was massive, and pure awesome. The cream-filled chocolate chip cookie pie we snagged was heavenly as well. Just the right flavor and not overwhelming.The staff was very friendly and I'm thrilled to have found this place! Another thing I really liked is that all of the items are vegan by default, but you can add dairy cheese and such if you want. Can't wait to go back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My wife made a reservation, at 8:15, so arrived hungry and excited to try this place. We arrived around 8:10, a little early. The hostess told us it'd be about 5 minutes, which was totally fine. About 8:20, our stomaches were rumbling but we figured we wouldn't have a problem until about 8:30. During our time waiting, we saw 3 parties coming out who were loudly complaining about the staff and service. Three parties of older people got seats pretty quickly.Around 8:30 I went up to the hostess and said we would sit outside if it would make it quicker, although there were two open tables inside and three outside. She said it would be about ten minutes, so I said \"that's what you said twenty minutes ago\". She asked if I had a reservation and when I got a little vocal, she apologized and sat us inside right away. After five minutes of sitting down, she told us she messed up and asked us if she could move us outside, where she ended up giving an older couple our seats. After 5-10 minutes outside, we finally got some service. All in all, it took us forty minutes to get our waters and 1:10 to get our food. Worse, the hosting staff came outside multiple times as two other customers had issues with being seated and getting service. The hosting staff blew it off as \"well, its restaurant week, what do you expect\".The food was pretty good. My pork chop was a little overcooked but it was a complex dish that I'm glad I tried, but not really worth going back for.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Nevertheless, I was roped into dinner on a recent Saturday night at the Yellow Porch and went along with an open mind. We were seated at the only open table, which was near the door, a door which was broken and remained open any time someone entered or exited the restaurant. This meant that from the time I sat down to the time I paid the bill I was blasted by the sub-freezing air outside. I got up several times, as did another man in our group, and several from adjacent tables, to close the door and ask the hostess to keep it closed as best she was able, but she continually ignored the problem, and not for other tasks which occupied her. She just stood up there behind the hostess stand with a look of resigned contempt on her face. My steak was unremarkable and slightly overcooked, the wines by the glass were too expensive for what they were, and I didn't see a manager the entire time I was there. All that said, the place was packed with old white people, so I guess they've figured out how to stay busy in spite of their many failings. They'll never get another dime from me.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had the B&E Mule cocktail- it was one of the best drinks I've had in Nashville: well balanced, spicy, very well done. Of course, for $11, it should be. The wine list is also very respectable.Now, for the \"eh\": our entrees were a solid average. I had the short ribs. I love short ribs. These were served atop blue cheese mashed potatoes and haricot vert. The ribs were well braised- very tender. However, they kind of fell flat for me- more or less tasted like a pretty good pot roast. Also, the mashed potatoes were under seasoned and lacked blue cheese flavor, and the haricot could have benefited from some citrus or other acid. All in all, this dish was fine, but no more spectacular than a good mom and pop plate of pot roast, mashed potatoes, and green beans.My wife had the filet- she ordered mid rare and received a heavy medium. It was served atop a gratin of some sort; it was too rich for the beef and underwhelming on the whole.Yellow Porch is fine, but I expected more from a Nashville restaurant in this price range.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The appetizers are one of my favorite parts. I've tried almost all of them but my favorites are the gnocchi with wild mushrooms and the antipasti plate. The sweet tea pork chop and a seared fish special were the favorites at our table on my most recent visit. The food is always well prepared, fresh, and very tasty.The service is great. On one visit there was a reservation mistake that the staff worked hard to resolve before our arrival. Without prompting, they gave us free appetizers to make up for the hassle. Waiters are non-intrusive yet attentive throughout the dinning experience. The dining area is pretty small, so make a reservation.Local art lines the walls and the dining room is dimly lit, with candles on every table. This is a great spot for either date night or groups.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My other son really liked the Ceasar's Salad with chicken as an entree. I had the Paella which was very good but not the paella I was expecting. A little soupy with not enough rice and no clams. The service was impeccable and it's the first time I ordered a 'short' espresso and got one in Nashville. We skipped dessert but we'll be back.I'd go 3 1/2 stars but there is no in between available.

I believed it may have sparked my own desire to become a Chef. I would highly recommend the Sweet Tea Brined Smoked Pork. It's literally heaven in a piece of meat. Though they change up the sides that come with it my favorite were the Benton's Bacon sweet potato pancakes.   I love everything about this meal. Sweet and salty perfection.My second favorite meals are the Lamb and steak. They are tied because I couldn't choose between the two.  However they are prepared they NEVER disappoint.

We started our meal with the cheddar fritters which were actually pretty good. Mainly downhill from there though. 2 of us ordered the New York Strip from the specials menu (without a price listed), 1 ordered the scallops and grouper special, 1 ordered a salad, and 1 ordered the Amish chicken. Both steaks were ordered medium and were served extra well done, so were sent back. The redo's were better cooked but still very bland, and reminded me of communion wafers. The scallops and grouper turned out to be a single scallop and a legitimate 2oz piece of fish.  Then came the bill - $200!!! $38 per steak, $28 for the single scallop and grouper finger. The only enjoyable things were the cheddar fritters and our waiter who actually did a good job. Will not be back and would not recommend it to anyone I don't hate.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were mid way into serving them!  She then took them to another table and left them. All four of us were in complete shock. The rest of the meal was excellent. We had the Vegetable lasagna, the penne bottola and the citrus chili dusted salmon. For dessert it was the creme brûlée. The attention to the food and the presentation were top notch.

I've driven past it so many times, and finally we were going there! Hooray. Its a cute place in Berry Hill that has deep reds (my favorite color) and dark shades. There were a few folks having business type meetings. The service for ordering food was prompt. Seats about 60 people ..and maybe thats being generous. Some menu items included the Seared Sirloin Greens, Reuben (and turkey Reuben), quesadillas, pastas. They have home made soups, tomato basil, potato and a blue cheese! Lots of salad options! For portion size comparable to price .. I was happy with my massive $8.50 salad. The greens weren't wilted and it was fresh. I got a cup of coffee, that tasted fresh brewed (even at noon!) on that chilly day. The art in the place is very colorful and cool. A nice not too romantic place for a great first date or nicer feel lunch. I was going to give this place a solid 5 star review but when asked to divide up a check our waitress was greatly annoyed. Then it took far to long to divide up the two salads and two drinks and pay with two cards. Maybe that was my hint I probably should have did good deed of the day and bought my coworker lunch. I was hoping she would buy mine! Ha! Next time....\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm extremely disappointed in that for numerous reasons. It shouldn't take over half an hour to get my food even during slow times. I'm a chef myself and I'd be dammed if I ever worked in a kitchen that had ticket times longer than 15 minutes. The servers are hardly servers...I'm still not sure if it's supposed to give off a more fast casual vibe or if the servers suck that bad. I also dislike how small the place is. Seriously, with how much business you guys get you should have expanded by now. I've asked multiple times about this for the past 3 years and have been told that \"we're working on it\". I hope some sort of owner gets to see this because I would love this place to only improve and not fail to all of the competition popping up. I would have complained in the restaurant but it never seems like there's a single responsible person available.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The Buffalo Bowl is definitely my favorite thing -- after ordering the Buffalo sandwich with a side of pintos for so long, it's great to get all of my favorite things in bowl form! They're very good about gluten free entrees and can make most things GF. Their GF baked goods come from April, who is known to gluten free people in Nashville for her baked goods elsewhere -- I was introduced to her via her baked goods at Matteo's in Brentwood, but she has a wider variety at The Wild Cow!Although I can't convince my boyfriend, whose culinary tastes include Hot Pockets and pizza, to try things with me when I go for my regular take out, our roommate loves their food as much as I do. They introduced me to kale, and for that I am most gracious.It's also very nice that they know their regulars! I'm always greeted by name when I show up!In short, highly recommended! I'm lucky to have this restaurant so close to my house, and on my way home from work at that!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My husband and I are not fast food eaters and since I'm veg it makes it very difficult to eat in the south. I found Wild Cow on Yelp and wanted to try it.Another review compared it to California vegetarian and I feel that it's a very unfair review. You really can't compare any Cali Veg places to anywhere because there are just so many and they are all so good. I got the Beans and Greens and it was so good that I'm going to try making it at home. I also got the add on of hummus (plan on garlic breath) and tahini which really complimented the dish. My husband ordered this too and he LOVED it. That's saying a lot coming from a meat eater. Anyway it was a welcomed meal in the vast valley of BBQ and fast food and the portion was plenty.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This place gets it, they use different cutting boards and utensils and if they don't know if its gluten-free or not they will tell you so. Love that! I also love that its vegan and gluten-free, now that is hard to come by!The food was good. I got the sides plate since nothing really seemed to jump out at me that day. Lentil Stew with garlic aioli was excellent, the BBQ tempeh was good but as bad as this sounds I wish they would batter it with rice flour and deep fry the thing, then cover it in the BBQ sauce, it was kinda bland, and I'm kinda spoiled by The Chicago Diners \"chicken\" wings. Hummus was artichoke basil, eh, nothing to write home about. My sis had their special which was braised seitan with brussel sprouts over quinoa, since it wasn't GF I couldn't try it but it looked really good! For dessert we had a sugar-free, GF, white chocolate mocha \"cheese\"cake, that thing was amazing!We also ordered a mimosa and a hard cider for me, both good. The bill was very reasonable, the place was clean, staff was nice and lucky for us it wasn't too crowded, but it did fill up as we were eating. Parking is interesting but plentiful.

The menu has changed.  I have to say, my gripes from my previous trips are staring to be ironed out.  They are making vegan food in its own right!  No more of this meat dish remade as vegan thing.  Last night I ordered the FarEastland bowl and wow.  My partner commented on how quiet I was and I couldn't even respond, I was too busy eating.  The peanut sauce was just the right amount, the kale was delish and the tofu on point.  I actually didn't need the brown rice underneath.  As for other items on their menu they are really starting to use tempeh, seitan and quinoa.  Interestingly enough the menu has a heavy Mexican influence. Not complaining!  The lentils side was yummy which means I'm probably going to end up eating the lentils bowl on my next trip.  If you haven't been to the Wild Cow lately you definitely need to stop in and taste their revamped menu!\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "When we pulled in a guy came up to the window and said there was no parking, turn around and park at the bank or down the road. You can't pull thru so there were 4 cars backed up trying to get back out to park somewhere else. The parking guy didn't really help, just watched everyone trying to get back out. The food was really really good, unfortunately due to a 'mix up' it took almost two hours to get it. They have a long and varied wine list but if you only want a glass and not the $150 bottle there are only two options for cab or merlot. I'm not a wine snob but more choices by the glass would have been nice. Sitting outside was nice at sunset.  The decor inside seemed a little run down, but I care more about good food than decorations. Our server didn't seem particularly interested in us, but that may have been because she had to take food to everyone around us even though they had gotten there after we had ordered. Don't get me wrong, good things take time and we weren't expecting fast food but 90 minutes is a long time to go without some reassurance that something is coming eventually. The restaurant was about half full so we felt a little neglected. We probably won't be back soon, which is a shame because the food was really good. The antipasti included a sun dried tomato pesto that really stood out and the scallops were perfect. But overall the  parking,  service, long wait, and high cost seemed to overshadow the food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I chose the salad with grilled salmon, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, etc. topped with balsamic vinaigrette. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the portion size was just right.

    "comments": "I ate here several month ago on a low-key date night. Nothing stood out about this place as superb, but I think sometimes that's nice. Everything about the night was nice, with no flair to get in the way.The atmosphere is nice and works for anything. On one side our table was a woman enjoying a book and a glass of wine by herself, on the other was a group of eight, and all of us got exactly what we needed. The service was great, food was good (though I really don't remember what I had). We had gift card from some friends, but the prices were such that I would have been more than happy to pay for the meal myself.So when I say \"nothing stood out about this place,\" it's not because of anything negative. It's just the opposite - it's because nothing got in the way of a great night. It's now the kind of restaurant I recommend anytime I drive by with someone, though I really don't have anything specific to say about it.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "While visiting Nashville, two friends and I stopped here for dinner. We didn't have a reservation (and didn't even know we needed one, as it was an idle Thursday and the website made no reference to it). Unfortunately, we were immediately met by a \"host\" who scolded us for not having a reservation (despite the fact that the restaurant was basically empty at that point.) He seated us, but his attitude had already put us all off. Our waiter came and collected our orders... We started off with appetizers and soup, unsure if we even planned on staying. (We did ultimately end up leaving without ordering mains.)We heard another table scolded because a member of their party was late and she was told that they wouldn't have enough time to eat if the person didn't show up soon (this was 5 hours, at least, from their closing time)... Basically they were just saying that they had booked the restaurant in such a way that the \"schedule\" of eating must be adhered to strictly...Personally I hate that idea in the restaurant business. If I am paying for a good meal, I want to be able to sit down and ENJOY it. I want to savor my food. I want to enjoy the people I'm dining with. I don't want to be on a tight time budget because you have overbooked your restaurant to the point where your diners are being rushed out the door. Seriously, how greedy can you get?For what it's worth, however... From what I tasted of the menu at Yellow Porch, I think they have the food chops... But what they lack completely are customer service skills and management to be successful.I would have enjoyed exploring their menu, and likely would have made a point to visit whenever I was in Nashville, but now I will never go back... Because while I love good food, there's so much more to having a successful restaurant that culinary skills.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

That being said, I had a delicious dinner (tea cured pork chops and pancakes, say whaaat?), but the atmosphere felt too cramped and the service wasn't so prompt. There also wasn't a big selection of vegetarian fare for my girlfriend. Why can't the \"nicer\" restaurants have something more on the menu other one freaking salad? Everything has be meat-centric in pricier restaurants, it seems.But I digress.So yes, what I ordered was good, prices were somewhat reasonable, but I wouldn't come back unless someone else wanted to.

I really enjoy dining outdoors, and the patio at Yellow Porch is excellent (especially for a more intimate setting). The menu is very nicely done. My two favorite entrees are the Seared Salmon, and the Paella. Both are seasoned very nice, and if you are a seafood lover as I am, you would appreciate these entrees. If you can catch a dessert, the strawberry shortcake is delicious. The wine menu is also very nicely done for all you enophiles. This is a great choice for great food, a feel of something more upscale, affordable menu and stellar service.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I sure am glad that Nashville can look forward to Restaurant Week each year. It gives it's fine residents a chance to get out and try restaurants it normally wouldn't. My girlfriend and I took full advantage of the discounts that local eateries were offering. Some good, some not so good. Yellow Porch was great! Do not be discourage by its rather strange location, out by 100 Oaks. It's total worth the adventure out there. The first thing that I noticed, was that the porch was not yellow. So, I'm wondering where the name came from. Maybe it use to be yellow, or there are future plans to paint it yellow. Maybe I should stop rambling on about the color of the porch and get to the important stuff. The food. The food was wonderful. The deal was $20 for an appetizer, salad or dessert and an entree. You should also know that they have a great wine list. We started with the Sweetwater Tennessee Cheddar Fritters and the Port Poached Sun-dried Cherry Salad. I expected the cheddar fritters to be extremely rich. But, they were not at all. I probably couldn't eat a whole serving by myself, but splitting those fritters with that salad was perfect. For dinner L had the Seared Salmon on roasted New Potatoes, roasted Asparagus, Crayfish, Creole Mustard and Baby Arugula with a Tarragon Creamy Vinaigrette and  Lobster Butter. And I had the Paella; fresh Fish and Shellfish simmered in a rich spicy broth with Saffron Rice, Onions, Peppers and Tomatoes. What's not to love about either of those entrees? Just thinking about them makes me want to detach from my computer and head down to Yellow Porch right now.Sorry to report, we didn't have any of the desserts they were offering. After eating almost every bit of our dinners, there was no room for any sweets. As much as we wished there was. And to top it all off, the service was top notch. Our server was extremely friendly and welcoming. He was helpful with helping up choose between a few different wines and entrees. What a great experience overall. I cant wait to return and see if the porch is yellow.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "WARNING: Friday and Saturday night Reservations are key at this place. They are normally booked solid 2 days in advance. Small parking lot and make sure you give yourself enough time to find parking or you may end up parking at the motel next door.FOOD: Had the mahi mahi. For $23, the portion size was small - maybe 8oz max. Veggies and side were good but the mahi mahi itself was way too salty. There were clumps of sea salt on the mahi mahi.Rest of my party all commented that today's visit had too much sea salt. When 1 of us threw out more than half of her entree, waiter did not even ask why or if anything was wrong.TERRIBLE SERVICE: Upon arriving, host told us \"we have another party in 75 min and you need to be done with dinner by then.\" I respect they need to turn tables to be profitable, but I don't respect that we were the only ones pressured. The table next to us arrived before us and had not even been offered dessert when our waiter returned (pressured by host) to hand us checks and remind us we only had 8 min. How can you book 2 tables for the same size party and yet only pressure 1 of them to leave in a set time frame?A member in our party commented that on his last visit, they waited over 15 min to be seated for their reservation so how do they determine who to pressure to get out?Our waiter refilled our sodas continuously as we enjoyed bread and appetizers. Once entrees arrived, he vanished when we needed refills most.$40 to be rushed through my dinner and choked to death on salt - I'll pass.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It smells so wonderful on the inside. We were quickly greeted after being seated. We ordered a three side plate as an appetizer- couscous salad, pineapple cole slaw, and the mushroom/red pepper special sides. The mushrooms and couscous salad were fabulous. The pineapple slaw was a little bland surprisingly. The hubby got the three taco plate that came with tortilla chips and salsa verde. He got three different tacos with the Chipolte Seitan being the absolute best. The seitan on this one had the consistency of steak/lamb. I got the veggie burger California style. The burger was great, just a little too much bread for my liking but I was quite pleased with the heaping amount of avocado and sprouts.

They have the best tofu ever.  It comes from Twin Oaks, which is a commune in Virginia that I used to buy tofu from when I lived in VA.  I know this because when I went there and got the tofu, it was a seriously good blast from the past and I asked where the tofu is from.  Twin Oaks is honestly the best tofu I have ever had.  Now, I went to this place the other night with a friend who is a vegetarian.  I ordered the beans and green, buffalo style with yummy buffalo tofu.  It was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The kale is perfectly cooked.  It's garlicky without being gross and the buffalo tofu? AWE-SOME.  I only hate half of my meal and brought the other half home (it turns out that tofu, beans, rice and kale is rather filling...) and late that night, (like 11pm) I was trying to fall asleep in bed and I was thinking about the amazing left-overs in my fridge and actually considered getting up and eating it right then and there.  But, I waited until lunch the next day and as soon as I opened the take-out container, my mouth started watering.  It was just as good the second day. The bottom line is: I need to go here way more often.  It's not far from my house, it's cheap and it's amazingly good food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "thank god for the wild cow. going from mostly vegetarian (i.e. eating meat a few times per year) to vegan recently, i was slightly overwhelmed thinking about where to eat out in nashville. then i visited wild cow one afternoon and was immediately relieved. yes, it is in east nashville (a small hike from over here in hillsboro village), but it never disappoints and is completely worth it. i have had quite a few things off of the menu, and thus far i have yet to be disappointed. some of my faves are the variety of sandwiches and tacos, and their breakfast/brunch specials are always right on point. i also love getting recipe ideas from wild cow, where i have attempted to make some of their dishes (some as successful, some not so much). just a note-wild cow is closed on tuesdays, but from 4-9 pm they do have an awesome buffet (changes weekly) where all the proceeds go to selected charities. and it's only $10. could it get any better? i think not.and then there's the kahn's desserts they serve. omg. sometimes i head over there just to get dessert for dinner if i'm in that kind of mood. everything i have had has been amazingly delicious, especially the carrot cake, mini key lime pies, and cupcakes. delic. only reason for the -1 star (which i so wish it could be -.5 star) is for the service. while everyone at wild cow is awesome and super friendly and informative, there is a slight lack of communication. almost every time i have been, multiple people have waited on me, and therefore me and my fiancee's food occasionally comes out in random order or we are asked multiple times for our drink order, etc. nothing major, but just want to mention it because i am one to like a little bit of consistency.thank you, wild cow, for making it easier to be a vegan in nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was vegetarian for several years and was so excited to hear E Nashville had a vegetarian/vegan restaurant! The atmosphere is nice, warm, inviting, staff friendly. You order at the counter, sit down and the staff brings the order to your table. Instead of giving you an order number, they give you a card with a rescue dog name and picture - LOVE this concept - great community partnering.Ordered the Homestyle plate - tofu, sweet potato hash, vegetable of the day, sauce (I choose peanut ginger) and side (ordered chips with tomatillo salsa). The salsa was disappointing - could not even taste the tomatilla as it was drowned it a bland red sauce (totally reminded me of Clancy's Fancy if you know what that is). Tofu was fine, although a very small portion (4 triangles), sweet potato hash was great (nice ginger flavor, crispy grilled) and peanut ginger sauce was acceptable (not a difficult sauce to make and nothing special with this one). The vegetable of the day was potato (sliced thin and fried, very greasy). BF ordered sweet potato tacos - 2 small corn tortilla shells with the sweet potato hash, cabbage and the tomatilla sauce, served with small portion of pinto beans and rice. Beans were bland, rice was unseasoned. Looking at our plates all I could think was \"where are the vegetables?\", \"is potato considered a vegetable?\" and \"CARB OVERLOAD!!!\". I love that Wild Cow exists and I love that they work with the E Nashville shelter to advertise dogs needing homes. I want to support this place, but cant justify spending money until the food improves. I can eat small portions of bland carbohydrates at home for free. I hope the owner takes some veg cooking classes or visits some great veg restaurants in other cities for inspiration soon.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'm beyond thrilled to have another fully-vegetarian dining option in Nashville, so it's possible I'm biased in Wild Cow's favor, but I thought the food served on opening night was outstanding, and the lunch I've had there since then was great, too. On opening night, they served a buffet-style assortment of dishes, most of which were vegan, but by far the most impressive was the vegan lasagna. Indistinguishable from dairy lasagna, for the most part. So I was a tad disappointed it wasn't available to order when I went back for lunch, but maybe it will make its way onto the regular menu at some point. What I DID order for lunch that was amazing was the reuben. You can choose tofu or tempeh, so I asked which one makes a more convincing reuben and the staff suggested tempeh. I really enjoyed it, but I wouldn't call the tempeh \"convincing.\" When I make reubens at home, I usually use something that has more resemblance to corned beef, like Yves Canadian Bacon, which at least has a salty savoriness that's comparable. I'd suggest to Wild Cow that they explore faux meat options to really perfect this sandwich, but that's not to say it isn't delicious as it is. One other opportunity for Wild Cow is to provide a raw option on their specials menu, and I've suggested something as simple as a chilled soup like gazpacho or borscht. I understand that this appeals to only a small percentage of the population, but I'm hopeful that enough people who are working raw vegan food into their diet will support them as they explore these menu specials to make it worth their while. They do, however, pretty consistently have a raw dessert option, and they have juices, including wheatgrass, so if you're raw, it's still worth checking out.All in all, this place is starting out strong and shows signs of being a great staple in Nashville's restaurant scene.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

On the downside, we were greeted the chilliest, most apathetic hostess ever.  Um... why are you a hostess again, lady?  You clearly don't give a flying flip about the impression you make on customers!  The space is also small and thus the tables are cramped together - expect to hear the neighboring table's entire conversation, and to possibly be hit in the head by a passing elbow.  The art on the walls is a bit juvenile as well; I feel like more thought could be put into the space and ambiance.  Although it seemed that most of the entrees on the menu were reasonably priced,  I found it outrageous that I paid $13 for a salad that had no meat or dairy in it, and included no local or organic produce.  Yes, it was good, but nothing I couldn't make easily at home for a fraction of the price.  :/ Wish there were more vegetarian-friendly options!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

After 20 minutes we went inside to check on our table and was told there still wasn't one ready but we could sit outside so we did. Our waiter immediately showed up with drinks and we said we needed a few minutes to decide on drinks and an appetizer. 10 minutes later he came back and we put all of our orders in. 45 minutes later our food came out. My steak was cold but his vegetable lasagna was ok. Overall the food was ok but not great, not worth the money. Service was terrible.

It is across the way from 100 Oak Shopping Center and next to some old and unsightly motel but the charm of this spot exudes a bit when you make your way to the porch. Our night started off a bit shaky as we still had a cramped 30 minute wait even though we made reservations but the staff swiftly followed up by offering up complimentary appetizers that included the Anitpasti Platter ($12)  that included salami, sopressata, Tennessee prosciutto, a selection of cheeses, hummus, sundried tomato pesto, and Greek olive mix. They also brought out Sweetwater Tennessee Cheddar Fritters ($7.95)with spicy aioli and Tennessee chow chow. Nice touch... unfortunately, my boyfriend and I are both on a juice fast and couldn't enjoy the beautiful layout of food. However, I was so very IMPRESSED by the fact that our friend who organized dinner called ahead to see if the could offer us any juice offerings and were told that the kitchen would be happy to put something together since they have fresh produce and a juicer on hand. I was happy to hear this news but still had no idea what they were going to be able to produce. Once we notified our waiter that we were the \"juicers\" he came out shortly with a large platter for the both if us with an actual juice flyte to enjoy. We each had an assortment of 5 juice that ranged from apple with spices, carrot, arugula, and more. Our overall experience cost $45 for the both of us but is totally in line with the pricing of other single serving juicing at Turnip Truck, Wild Cow, and Whole Foods.W.O.W. The thoughtful presentation and willingness to step outside of their menu really made a believer out of me... the insanely delicious looking vegetable lasagna that my friend ordered promised a nice future for Yellow House and me too!The overall vibe is nice and low-key with darker mood lighting. This is a great spot for a romantic evening or if you are seeking a quiet dinner. Wine prices were fair and the parking situation was not stressful.I will definitely hit up Yellow Porch soon and will likely upgrade them another star once I am able to taste their sold foods!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The bread with olive oil dipping concoction was a great start. Then I had the salmon entree and the tiramisu for dessert. Both were great. The salmon was served with roasted potatoes and a combination of mustard sauce, balsamic vinegar glaze and probably something else, along with some greens. The tiramisu was creamy and delicious. I think I ate everything on my plate in both cases. The place was packed on a Tuesday - most likely because it was RW. Service was a little slow, but we were in no kind of hurry. We had a pretty large group - 9 women - and enjoyed our evening as a whole.While I was there, I looked at the regular menu and believe the normal prices are quite reasonable given the quality.

Additionally, it's just pretty expensive. If I'm going to pay $17 for my entree alone, I want you to BLOW MY MIND.mind not blown.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We had a reservation, but arrived 30 min early and were seated promptly.   Service was polite and professional, with a nice touch of Southern hospitality.  Though the area felt a bit cramped,  and the theme was a bit on the dark side, it still rendered a a nice evening out for all of us. Everything from the appetizers, wine, main entrees and desserts were simply delicious and generous in proportion.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite and it garnered a lot of praise from my group weeks afterwards. Great for a date night, or a small group event. Mmmmm...fantastic quality meals!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Like a prison grey.Inside, tables are packed together to squeeze every last inch of seating space. It's like sitting someplace where they want to make sure they can keep an eye on everyone... like a prison.Seating outside, on the patio is more spacious. Unfortunately the heat in a Nashville summer is oppressive. Yeah, like a prison.The restaurant itself tries to be a top tier eating establishment. Food you won't find at a chain eatery, Things like an eggplant and goat cheese lasagna, or a sweet tea cured pork chop. But the waitstaff is your ordinary run-of-the-mill staff. Not bad, but not the kind of service that would make you want to go back. What kind of workers would try to treat you well, but would rather not have you come back? Prison guards.The food itself, is worthy of a 4-star dining establishment. Chef Guerry McComas has real talent. His skills are above this place.I hope to taste his food once he is paroled from the \"Yellow Porch\".\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

In the past, I've had great experiences with the salmon but I wanted to save a little money & try something new. I opted for the Italian sandwich which was very flavorful but a little greasy! I had to eat it with a fork and knife because it kept falling apart. I like that they give you veggie chips with it instead of the usual. And the bread and dipping oil at the beginning was probably my favorite part! I spilled oil on my shirt--major bummer--and my server was quick to offer help. She was very personable and added to the relaxed atmosphere.They need to do some redecorating. The interior is very dated and gloomy. Even though the art on the walls is colorful, it drowns in the dour burgundy of the rest of the place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had called earlier in the day to make reservations and I'm glad I did. Even at that we couldn't get reservations until 8pm. Parking is awful, so be prepared for that. My husband and his friend ordered a salad and starter to begin. They planned to pass on dessert. I did the opposite! I had the waiter bring out the Chocolate Espresso Torte as my starter. I considered licking the plate it was so good. I loved the fruit \"sauce\" swirled on the plate, too. Then I had the blackened shrimp and grits for dinner. Holy cow! It was such a unique spin on a traditional dish. I loved it. The six shrimp were cooked perfectly. Although I would never have thought to add cabbage to the grits I thought it was a good surprise. The service was spectacular! He was knowledgable - knew the dishes well and what was/was not gluten free - and paid us just the right amount of attention. The ambiance was great. It's a very quaint spot - good for dates not children. I will run, not walk, back to this little gem!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

There were at least 4 veggie options! I had the Greek Salad- it had warm eggplant, couscous, artichoke hearts, spinach, feta, and a balsamic dressing. Sooo good and totally the perfect portion. My boyfriend had the sun-dried cherry salad with salmon. He enjoyed is as well. The salad would have been small without the salmon or protein add-in. Plus, they give you bread with your lunch so I thought it was the perfect amount of food in the end and the bill was less than $30 bucks.My only minus is that the inside of the restaurant was so dim. They have large windows looking out onto the porch and in comparison to the sunlight, everything inside was dim. I'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu and will bring my friends.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I think it probably measures up better in a sandwich. Seitan was Ok, waitress did fess up that\"we get it in\".Organic wine was very acceptable and all in all I think this place will succeed nicely in time.  Service is good but the amount of diners showing up maybe putting too much pressure on right now.Just goes to show we need more places like this in Nashville\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It gave me ideas for things to cook at home. I had the vegan burger California style (avocado and sprouts). It was delicious. The side of mashed sweet potatoes had onions and was a little spicy.

It also has a \"clean\" taste, in that it isn't greasy or salty, especially concerning the pintos. It is a mild dish, which I'm attributing to regional tastes (sort of, as a pass), but it was nothing a squeeze of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce couldn't kick up a notch. I also like the use of brown rice. I always mess it up at home, so it's nice to be able to know what the texture is supposed to be (not crunchy!). The restaurant is so ascetically pleasing in its design. They play awesome music, which always adds to my experience anywhere.It's true that space is an issue here, but I have no doubt they can expand quickly. Finally, the ladies room: it is the squeakiest-cleanest I've come across lately, so I know the same care is likely taken in the kitchen. I am a germ phobe. These things matter to me.

Everything I've had has been good, and that includes the vegan cheesecake. I would have said THAT was impossible - and honestly, it doesn't really taste like cheesecake, but it's still tasty. They have a nice but small selection of beers.The service is terrific. Even though you order at the counter and random people bring your food out to you, they still manage to keep track of you and make sure you don't need anything.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Out of the car, stumbling into Wild Cow in sunglasses and clothes from the previous night, we were hoping for decent. What we received, in terms of service and food, was perfect. Inside it was crowded; standing room only, but a sweet server sensed our desperation and seated us immediately. We ordered hangover remedies of the gods-- peach kombucha and ginger ale with real ginger--and waited on our food. it was probably our fault that we didn't order an appetizer--the place was so busy, I can't fault our food for taking a while, but when it finally came, it was incredible. The French Quarter Dip was outstanding, and the Veggie Burger--picnic style, (coleslaw on top, bbq on the side) was heavily charred and had the freshest vegetables on top. Our sides of spicy kale and grilled tofu hit the spot and were served on separate plates; perfect for sharing tapas-style. All of our servers were polite and funny--or perhaps they were just laughing at our sorry selves, rumpled clothes, or the rate at which we consumed our food..both plates totally clean in seven minutes. Haven't quite decided. What we do know is that we'll be back, hopefully in better form, for the Monday night special of veggie burger/chips/high gravity beer for $10...and to sample the delicious-looking vegan desserts. So travel to East Nashville. Go Native. Cure your raging hangover with food that's good for you and great for the environment. Eat like it matters--because it does. \"Civilization ends at the waterline. Beyond that, we all enter the food chain, and not always right at the top.\"-Hunter S.

Cow.  I love it so much, I often mess up its name when telling others.  In my mind, it's \"Happy Cow\".  Many of the wonderfully creative menu items are omnivore's knock-offs, but better.  Buffalo Tempeh sandwich?  Ruben?  Veggie burgers?  They're all spectacular.  (Especially the Buffalo tempeh.  I've missed the idea of buffalo wings for years now, but never enough to brave chicken - or even to really want to.  I've tried the buffalo cauliflower bites, buffalo chips, buffalo sunflower seeds... but all to no avail.  Wild Cow does it right.  The sandwich has shaved carrots and celery for crunch and is something special - the last bite has always been as good as the first, and as regretted as the first was anticipated.)  Try the sweet potato tacos with the black beans and jerk sauce.  Or the kale.  But do save room at the end for a cookie sandwich with icing in the middle - you'll be glad you did.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The carnivorous craving will be meet and surrendered in the complexity of flavored, humble service and daringly reasonable price points. Upon entering there's signage asking guests to wait for a seat. The communal business model has everyone doing everything. Servers buzz around completing different tasks in second hand clothes and chipped nail polish. The quaint establishment has three booths and naked wooden tables. I order the French Quarter Dip and Pinapple Slaw. The mixture of three different vegetarian fare are stuffed in a wheat hoge with a side of au jus. Meat is not missed as the rich garlic onion flavored burst a la French Dip. The au jus is the most delightful in this duo soaking up into the roll then bursting on the palette! I am a hard core meat eater, extra rare type and I adored this filling sandwich! The slaw, fresh not as flavorful. If they would streach their pasture and glam up the cow a bit in atmosphere they would be more in demand.I will dread it up and grab my boyfriends flannel for the next visit. It is grubby casual, wear your dirty clothes and no makeup so you fit it. I hope The Wild Cow will never fit in to the stereotype of vegetarian eats. They march to a beat all their own and have tamed this carnivour to their side, if only for a day. Maybe I'll mess up my new French manicure and chip my nail polish, nah!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had salmon, seared and encrusted with herbs, and slightly rare. It was moist and delicious! It came with roasted new potatoes, the best mushrooms I've ever had, tomatoes and various herbs. Mom had Paella, which I tasted. It was equally as succulent!We couldn't resist a little creme brulee for dessert, which of course did not disappoint. I'll definitely come back here.

Three of the six in our dinner party were pescetarians (no meat, chicken, or pork) and we all smiled in unison when we saw the menu. There were no less than 6 options for us and they each sounded amazing. We started with drinks and apps -- I had the mussels. I was floored when the waiter brought a heaping mound of mussels in a super fragrant broth and placed them in front of me. I literally had to stop myself from shoveling them in my mouth nonstop. They were excellent and I am not sure if I could have improved upon them at all. (Something I don't say often given my 20-year hobby of cooking).My entree of blackened shrimp over grits and sauteed spinach was just about as good as the mussels. If I had made the dish, I would have given it a little heat. Then again, that's my preference and not the fault of the chef. Other people at the table got the lasagna, the filet and (I think) the pork chop. All of our plates were clean ... We were slightly rushed out after the meal was over because they allegedly had another party of 6 coming in. The host kept peering over the divider screen to see if we were done. It was annoying and there were 2 open tables by the window. When we exited, we noticed no one was waiting in the foyer. So it all felt so unnecessary. I don't want to gloss over this annoyance, but the food was so good it will have no bearing on my future visits here. I literally cannot wait to go back and try something else.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Yellow Porch came highly recommended by essentially everyone we know in Nashville and everyone we knew outside of Nashville who knew anything about Nashville. It's gotta be good, right? Wrong.The wine list was nice. A little bit of everything from every region both whites and reds. However, we had the waiter open the bottle we'd brought from our own collection, as there wasn't anything comparable on the list for less than $60 - 80.To start we had the cheddar fritters, and they were great. Really, really good. This concludes the end of the good things about Yellow Porch.For entrees my wife and I had the paella and pork chop, respectively. The paella reminded me very much of rice and tomatoes that my mom used to make when I was growing up, but not in a good way...in the \"we mixed a can of tomatoes and some water with rice and put it on a plate\" sort of way. The shrimp were terribly-overcooked pieces of fishy-tasting rubber. The mussels were inedible. Tasted very much like dirt. Literally.The pork chop was a nice, thick-cut loin. However, it was prepared in a very sticky, overly-sweet bath of marinade, which completely covered the taste of the meat. Comparable to something you'd find on the $7.99 TGIFriday's special menu. The Hoppin' John that came with was great. Really good.We skipped dessert, obviously.On the service: After pouring our first glasses of wine, the waiter returned only once to take our entree orders. Someone else delivered our water refills. At one point the waiter acknowledged my wife while she was preparing to refill her own wine glass, and he never offered to help. He did not bring the pre-meal bread that all of the surrounding tables received promptly. He also did not acknowledge my wife's picked over paella (all mussels remaining and a half-eaten shrimp on the side) except to say, \"You must want a box for this.\"I wouldn't return to Yellow Porch even if they offered to host our return trip at no charge.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My husband had the lamb which on the regular menu. It was really good and perfectly seasoned. I ordered a fish special, which I believe it was a sergeant fish, which came with a fantastic risotto and perfectly cooked fresh crispy green beans.The wine list is pretty good but marked up quite a bit.  For example a bottle of Smoking Loon Pinot Noir was $30 which you can buy at any grocery store for probably less than $15. With 2 glasses of wine, an appetizer and two entrees, our bill came to around $85 or so after taxes but before tip.  I'd definitely recommend making reservations for quick seating.Overall, a cute local place with good food and good service.  We'll definitely be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Meat can be added for an additional fee (chicken, salmon or steak). I really like ordering a fillet of salmon on the side (oh so juicy, about 3-4 ounces). This allows me to take about half my pasta back to work to enjoy later in the week (it's tastes great reheated as well!). I also normally get an appetizer here. I really like splitting the quesadilla with the table with the chipotle sauce on the side (I don't have a high spice tolerance). Or their soups are delicious. A friend of mine loves the cheese and celery soup.One of the best things is they have outdoor seating, so you can really enjoy the Nashville weather. They have two options. One is more covered than the other, which keeps it about 10 to 15 degrees cooler. They also have fans in the covered area.This is a weekly staple in my lunch routine. They have a specials menu that changes daily in addition to their standard lunch menu. (I've only been here for lunch.) If you're feeling a little daring, they have an excellent wine menu and a 10 year Taylor Fladgate port wine (which they'll also serve by the half glass). They take reservations if you're party's over 5 people.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My boyfriend and I came here for lunch after reading so many positive reviews. I don't know if we had a new server or if it was an off day, but the service was horrible. Our drink orders were immediately taken by the server who seated us and when our waitress came by I needed another minute to deliberate the menu choices. Big mistake. It took almost 15 minutes for her to return. She brought me the wrong wine because she \"couldn't find\" the one I ordered--off the lunch specials menu and didn't even bother telling me until I was halfway done with it. Not a big deal for me bc I don't know my white wines but I still feel she should have told me immediately and offered other choices instead of just picking another one at random. Then, my boyfriends burger was well done when he ordered medium, there was no dressing for his side salad/greens but he just used the oil/vinegar mixture from the bread since we knew it'd take 30 minutes to get the dressing he ordered. We immediately asked for more bread with our entrees and 20 minutes later we got it after we were both done with our meals. Overall, the lunch took over an hour and a half start to finish. They were not busy and had plenty of staff. I'm extremely disappointed. My linguine was mediocre at best.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Sometimes my initial response to the descriptions is that they've thrown in everything and the kitchen sink but it always tastes good. Recently I had the special, which had a chipotle dressing that was excellent. Also love the greek salad. The porch is a lovely place to sit and have some sun shine down. the service is very friendly and accommodating, but the timing can be a bit stop and start. I'd keep coming back--nice change from the usual office lunch! Be aware the parking lot is a bit of a mess so try and carpool.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "As many other reviewers have said, Yellow Porch is one of my favorite restaurants in Nashville. The food is the winner here...they obviously have been blessed with quite a gifted chef. Assuming he/she at least helped create the menu, the chef is quite imaginative and inventive as well. yum! Although a tad bit spicy for me, I love the blackened shrimp and grits.    Service here is hit or miss, depending on who you get I suppose. It's true they don't encourage anyone to stretch their visit out, but at the same time, it's pretty impossible to get out of there in a quick amount of time. And, really, a meal like this should be savored and appreciated anyway...not hoovered down like a vacuum cleaner. So, unfortunately there is a relatively small window in between how long a meal \"should\" take, and how long is too long (i.e. how quickly they hope to turn the tables).     The parking, or lack thereof, is an issue. It would be nice if they worked that out in some way.     If anything, this review shows just how much I love their food. Despite these things it has going against it, it remains a favorite of mine.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Many years ago this was one of my favorite places to treat myself to lunch. They had an incredible 'tuna salad' unlike when one thinks of as tuna salad. It had tuna with a simple oil, lemon and herb dressing with capers. Served with haricot vert and marinated cherry tomatoes. We had also been to dinner here once but we just never seem to venture up this way for dinner. Last fall I had the opportunity to work with Chef Guerry McComas and his sous chef Joey Lamb at the Cooking Wild With Coach Jeff Fisher benefit for Second Harvest. First, I really enjoyed working with them but then when I got to taste the extras, I was smitten. That was probably the single piece of fish I had ever put in my mouth. So when I saw a gift certificate for Yellow Porch at a charity silent auction, I had to have it. And when the hubby asked me out for a date last night, we decided it was time to use it. We got there early on a Friday evening (before 6:30) only to find out that between early birds and reservations, the place was pretty well booked. We got the last table. While the whole menu looked great, I love to try the nightly specials. DH had the Beef Stroganoff special and I had the Mahi-Mahi special. I had eaten a late lunch and didn't want to over-order but I have to tell you that the celery blue cheese soup special still has me intrigued and wanting to try it. DH's beef stroganoff was perfection in a bowl. It was a generous serving of tender beef tenderloin in a mushroom sour cream demi over orrechiette pasta with smoked paprika. It also had some wilded greens in it - didn't try them but DH thought it was spinach. He said this reminded him of his mother's and that hers was the best he had ever had. So this was a good thing. It was obvious they meant for you to enjoy every last bite because a spoon was placed on the table before it came to the table. My seared mahi mahi might even top that piece of halibut that first made me fall in love with Chef McComas's cuisine to start with. It was paired with a winter vegetable beluga lentil ragout, haricot vert, a parsley coulis and lemon thyme aioli and garnished with something I couldn't quite make out but that both DH and I loved. Come to find out it was a tasso grit crouton - this wonderful combination of lightly crisp and soft and creamy and salty smokey pork goodness. I kept going from one element of the dish to another savoring each one and trying to decide what was my favorite part of the dish. No need to worry, all of them were my favorite and I used a piece of the bread to make sure I got every last bit of the sauces. We finished off the meal by sharing a piece the bananas foster white chocolate bread pudding. I don't typically love bread pudding but this one was love at first bite. While it was extremely rich, the flavors were perfectly balanced. I was afraid the white chocolate was going to be too strong since I am not a real fan of white chocolate but it was so well balanced that it didn't jump out at you. You have to pay attention to where you are going because this place is easy to miss and pass by before you know it.  It doesn't look like much from the outside with construction underway on one side almost hiding it from view when coming from Powell or coming from the east on Thompson Lane.  And the leftover 50's motel on the left, well let's just say it adds character to the neighborhood.  However, once you are inside, the atmosphere is cozy though a little cramped at times. The noise level is better than most restaurants these days thanks to the fact that they softened the ceiling with fabric. It's also nice to know that there are places like this that you can enjoy a wonderful meal without having to dress up and that there are all ages and types in here.  During the warmer months there is a nice patio out front.Service was almost perfect at the start but did slow some as all the tables filled up and our server had a large party. It was still very good it was just the speed that slowed down a little. Chef McComas was very visible throughout the night. I must take special note of how accommodating they were. Garlic does not agree with D so he asked about it being in the dish and they came back and said that it was but because it is made to order they could leave it out and that Chef McComas did not think it would adversely affect the dish. I also noted that they accommodated one of the younger members of the party next to us by fixing her a dish of pasta with butter and cheese. This is definitely a place we will be returning to more often now.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I am looking.\" So I mentioned that was rude, and tried to persuade my party of 3 to go elsewhere.  We stayed for bread and appetizers, because our server was EXTREMELY nice and very prompt. We were still fuming at the way we were treated upon arrival so we then asked to talk to a manager.  BIG MISTAKE. We informed the manager that we did not appreciate the greeting we received, and in told him exactly what had happened.  We were not trying to score a free meal or any such thing.  The manager then informed us that the greeter was OVERWHELMED by the reservation book.( THE TABLES WERE ALL EMPTY! ) We said that we had asked if we should make a reservation, the manager then tells us that \" Unfortunately everyone in Nashville wants to eat her at between 6&7pm. Manager was really defensive of the rudeness of his greeter.   I then advised him we were from out of state, and this was our FIRST time here.  All he said was \"again I am sorry but he was just overwhelmed.\"  Sooo upon hearing that response, we decided NOT to spend our money on dinner.  We all lost our appetites.  We will not return as first impressions are everything. We did order the Ricotta Gnocchi and fritters as our openers, both were good, I also ordered the Celery blue cheese soup, which I actually liked a lot.   Tip: Make a reservation so the greeter does NOT get ovetwhelmed by reservation book in a restuarant of empty tables, so therefore he treats people as if they have no business eating there. Parking lot is small. Price is higher than Yelp advertises. I would give $$$.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Two things put us off a bit. One is that it's obviously been discovered by the young hipster crowd (thanks a lot, Yelp!), which is fine but one of the things we always have enjoyed is the quiet romantic ambience. Not so much this time, although we did get one of the lovely tables for 2 in the alcove. Still a bit busy/noisy for us older folk. The second problem was really my mistake. I felt like a steak and noticed they had a NY Strip special that evening. I don't eat much beef and would normally only order it at a bona fide steakhouse (which Yellow Porch is not). Anyway, in a moment of weakness I ordered it and let's just say I was pretty disappointed. Not a very good cut of meat with lots of gristle and no sign of aging whatsoever. As I said - my mistake for ordering it against my better instincts. Otherwise all was good and we still like Yellow Porch, but we will remember it a little less fondly, I think. And that's a shame.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were involved in a movie marathon and had limited time. They have a very efficient security man that showed us where to park, because the lot is small, and the service, once in, was excellent!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was thinking of giving three stars, but last week I had a phenomenal pork chop with all sort of fancy stuff on the side: spinach, sweet potato fritters, apple chutney. It was $19.95 which is a tad more than I usually pay for dinner,  but it was yummy and the portion was satisfying. My mom had a huge bowl of pasta tossed in a spicy vodka sauce. Its was also tasty. However, on one trip years ago I spied a little trail of ants marching in through a crack in the floor. I pointed it out to the hostess on our way out and I've never noted anything like that since. All in all I recommend the Yellow Porch if your looking for fine dining at reasonable prices. Definitely a good spot for the ladies who lunch.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had the celery and bleu cheese soup which was freaking awesome, some tilapia with roasted vegetables which was pretty dern average, and the creme brulee which was also freaking awesome. So, my judgment is that the place is pretty freaking awesome. My only beef was that we had a group of 12 and they put some tables together. Some of the chairs were literally up ON another table of 4. I'm betting the other party was seated before the tables were shoved together; otherwise they probably would not have sat there. I felt bad for the last people to arrive. But, yanno, table of 12, Restaurant Week, not the brightest idea, so hey.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Although we didn't have reservations, they were able to sit us on the patio. It was actually pleasant with a slight breeze. Anyway, the food is always good. We live in Brentwood, I prefer Wild Iris, my wife prefers the Yellow Porch. Started with Crawfish Cakes and Tomatoes Basil soup. Both were good. I'm from New Orleans and fancy myself a very good home cook. I've made Crawfish Cakes with Crawfish Cream Sauce many times (Emeril recipe) and while YP missed the mark because the breading to crawfish ratio was off (too much breading), it was good. We had the Salmon and BBQ Shrimp for entrees -- both were excellent. As always, the service was very friendly and attentive. We didn't have wine, but the list has some nice selections.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Ever.Thus I consider myself a fair judge of all things vegetarian.The Tempeh sandwich and the Tofu sandwich my wife ordered were okay okay. I liked the veganaise, but wasn't really blown away. The soup was nice and chunky. The avocado and lime smoothie was a little difficult to accept, but novel probably. The decor was chic and local as expected in that hippie neighborhood. Overall, I would like if they had more choices and have more cooked fare. You know, deep fried fritters in tempura or sweet potato fries and stuff.

Their vegan mac and cheese is good. The cole slaw needs some work. Overall, this is a really good restaurant with healthy and fresh food with a friendly staff. If you are interested in exploring vegetarian food, this place is a good option. The menu offers a good selection.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I am usually not excited about vegetarian restaurants unless its Indian food, so it took me a while to get to this newer place on the east side. Now I can't stay away. Today I had the veggie burger Muppet style, with a lovely chilled roasted tomato soup. Everything I have had here is delicious -consistently fresh tasting, responsible portions that leave you satisfied but not weighed down, and all healthy. Some of it is simple, but other things on the menu I know I could not do at home, like the funky green sauce, unusual sauerkraut and gigantic pickles on my Muppet burger, or the surprising soup from today, for example. Great location (filling part of a mixed-use building in an emerging corner of East Nashville), nice people, and needed addition to the local food options get it to five stars for me.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I wanted to like Yellow Porch, but it seems that fate was against it. I'll try to be brief as I sum up our misadventures here last night:To be fair, it is Restaurant Week in Nashville, which means that we're maybe experiencing something that's a little different from the norm.  Even taking that into consideration, I give them a 2-star rating.First, the parking lot is tiny - we had to park up the street a good way.Second, while some might say cozy, others might say cramped.  I was seated on the aisle and spent much of the night getting bumped in to.  Third, our server was apparently also bar tending while also keeping tabs on a number of tables.  While she spent lots of time with our neighbors, she always seemed to forget us.  It took about 30 minutes to get water and the correct menus.  Fourth, bonus points for the bread situation - they have a nice dipping sauce of olive oil, pesto, feta, and balsamic vinegar, which was super tasty.Fifth, (and hear is where the review might stray from the norms because of Restaurant week) we ordered from the special menu and it was generally a disaster.  The salad was a handful of greens and three croutons.  Weak.  The entree was paella, which looked more like a Zataran's box of rice plus two shrimp.  Equally weak.  The dessert was the highlight of the meal.  We tried three at our table, the vanilla bean creme brulee (very nice despite the burnt sugar), the chocolate espresso torte (probably the best), and the banana's Foster white chocolate bread pudding (great flavor but heavy and texturally blah).So, in conclusion - Yellow Porch really made the worst of a good opportunity.  Restaurant Week should be used to give people a taste of the best you can do.  But it seemed as though they were cheaping out.  They certainly didn't serve anything that will inspire me to go back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The acorn squash was bland and undercooked, so I gave up on that. I ordered a cup of coffee after that was terrible. Its not very hard to use great coffee here in Nashville. I feel like I may have had a below average experience here and perhaps the executive chef was off the night we went.

    "comments": "Went there last night for my birthday dinner -- we had a 7:15 reservation but when we arrived, the hostess said that a group was lingering at our table. The manager went to talk to the \"lingerers,\" which made me uncomfortable because I think people should be able to relax and enjoy their time at a restaurant without being rushed to turn over a table. We waited 30 minutes (while other parties were being seated) and eventually just asked to sit on the porch, as it was a bit chilly but there were open tables. The manager came by with a free appetizer, and offered us an additional appetizer and two glasses of wine on the house. I was pretty cranky by then, but this totally made up for the wait.The food was GREAT. We had:Cheddar fritters - wouldn't have ordered these normally, but they were brought over by the manager, and they were awesomeSteamed mussels - lots of mussels with amazing broth and toasted bread to soak it all upSalmon - delicious, not too salty, quite a large portionBlackened shrimp - just the right amount of shrimp, grits, spinach, and roasted red pepper coulis, really really tasty, but a little on the salty sideSo overall, awesome food, great wine list, beautiful interior, but they need to stop packing in reservations as tightly as they can, and let people take a little more time to enjoy it all.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Average.  Was kind of excited to try a place called \"Yellow Porch\". I my mind I've conjured up an image of a little yellow farm house type place, restaurant in a home vibe (sort of like the Pfunky Griddle or Margot).  Sadly, what I got was just an average place in an odd area of town and the shades were drawn on a nice, blue sky day which my partner and I found kind of odd.The lunch menu was fine - soups, salads, sandwiches. Nothing extraordinary (not that there's anything wrong with that) but the execution was also not that extraordinary (for something called Yellow Porch, in my mind).  I had the Greek salad with couscous - one piece of roasted eggplant, half slice of portobello mushroom, a sprinkling of feta cheese.  Meh...underwhelming, really.  Bf had the turkey club which was more of a turkey sandwich with bacon.  Certainly not what we normally expect of a \"club\" sandwich which is three layers, fresh lettuce, tomato, turkey, bacon...this was just a sandwich.  Boring.

    "comments": "I have eaten at the yellow porch twice. Once for dinner and today for lunch. My experiences were similar both times. Decent food paired with below average service. The dinner service was acceptable by all counts but the lunch service was well below expectations. We were sat not once but twice as the hostess wasn't sure what tables and servers were available (lunch is busy, acceptable) but the server was oblivious (lunch is busy, somewhat acceptable). We order directly and immediately from the lunch menu with no special requests. My wife ordered a typical lunch salad but declined to add any chicken, steak, etc. when asked.  My order came out prompt and as expected. My wife's salad came out the size of a small side salad at most restaurants and way undersized for a lunch portion (a side salad at any chain is significantly larger). When I asked the server regarding this we were told when a lunch salad is purchased without a $4 meat add on it is much smaller. This was her explanation after the fact and she did not even ask if we would like to upgrade or order anything additional for my wife. She immediately wandered off seemingly annoyed that we didn't know about the absurdly small $7 vegetarian salad and had the audacity to ask. All in all this is a not a terrible place to eat and if rated on the quality of the food alone would deserve a bit higher rank but when accounting the location, service, price point, and decor there are simply too many other options in and around Nashville which are significantly better.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Ok here's the thing, I'm from and live and work in San Francisco, you know, the \"city by the Bay\" where you can get anything and everything at the drop of a dime and if it' seafood, well, thank God the Pacific ocean is right there. So I have to say I'm a fairly fair critic on seafood and foodfare when it comes to most types of food. I went to Yellow Porch with my boyfriend and his family on one of my trips to NashVegas and wasn't expecting much. It was a fairly unsuspecting location that reminded me of someone's giant open dining room with a bar in it. Ambiance was cool but all of a sudden I look down at the menu and it's got appetizers $8-10 and entrees $14-19. It all looked tasty but with prices like that, even in San Francisco you get some ambiance pizazz for that! (Maybe it's the vibe they're going for?)The bread was awesome, the wine selection was moderately impressive considering it was 2500 miles from Napa. They were also helpful at picking good wines to match the moods of the ladies at the table. The bread was fantastical with the dipping sauce and the service was great (it was probably 1/5 full and we were the largest party). I ordered the blackened shrimp with grits (melding my love of the south and california...naturally). The shrimp was mediocre, it was a little over peppered (I occasionally let out one those \"stuck to my throat\" pepper coughs) and I think the shrimp might've been pre-frozen as it wasn't plump or juicy like fresh store bought shrimp. The grits were delish, didn't get the mini salad on top of it but i just dusted it off to the side. Their crab cakes were also pretty good, not sure if you get so much bang for your buck at I think around $7 and ONE crab cake but I won't jock 'em too hard on that since it was impressive for a landlocked location. My boyfriend however ordered fish and devoured it faster than I could cut the tails off my shrimp.I'd say it's great if you want a moderately healthy dinner and are willing to splurge and don't care too much about a crazy swank ambiance. If you love your seafood there's actually more of it here (like salmon and halibut specials) than you'd find at other places in the area. But do expect gourmet prices with gourmet looking dishes in a uber casual environment.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our last visit for lunch was on par, had the salmon with salad. Fresh, cooked perfectly and just the right amount of dressing. Wine list is very solid for a small list and seems to constantly evolve.

    "comments": "Vegetarian, natural and animal loving is the heart here. Farm animals providing the dairy ingredients are treated with respect on the local farms where they live. They get no hormones, antibiotics or other such supplements and are treated humanely. You can enjoy your cheese dishes with a clear conscience and be confident that the food is at its healthiest. Some of their offerings like baked goods are even vegan for those so inclined. You should try the seitan which is  a protein rich wheat product that's chewy like meat, but vegetarian. It's not always on the menu, so call in advance to let them know you want it and they can try to prepare it for you. If you want to be clever get a quasi-meat seitan dish and bring it to your carnivore friend. They may like it enough to hop on the train to vegetarianism. Sandwiches, salads, sides and entrees are all good for you here and good to our fellow creatures.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Went there last weekend with some other families down in Nashville for parents weekend at Vanderbilt. It was well recommended on Yelp and I use Yelp all the time with great results every time. This time was no different. We were a large group of 15 and the service was good considering, although the waitress did mix up 2 salads. Several different dishes were ordered and not one person had a bad thing to say. I myself ordered the Marinated Chicken Breast on Homemade Chicken Sausage Linguini Pasta Pie, sauteed Spinach, Cacciatore sauce and a shaved Fennel and Parsley relish.It was delicious. My husband had the Penne Pasta Pasta with Garlic and Tomatoes in a Spicy Vodka Cream Sauce with Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese. He loved it. The rest of the party had the Blackened Shrimp, Salmon, Filet mignon and Paella amongst them. The Salmon was not overcooked as is the case in a lot of restaurants. For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding, it was good but not the best I have had, too dense for me. It was a large portion so you can share it with 1-3 people. My son had the creme brulee and said it was almost as good as Paris! Everyone was pleased and thank me for choosing this place. I will tell you though, when you drive up to it, the restaurant looks like nothing, but inside it is very nice and the food is well worth the reasonable prices.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was ready to be disappointed and have bad service, but I was totally surprised. My parents and I had an amazing meal here that was way better than expected. We did eat early, actually around 530, so it was not busy and we had a nice table on the patio. It was not crowded yet. A good round of cocktails came first and then we had an antipasti plate with meats and hummus that was delicious. The big closer of the night were the fish entrees though. My mom and girlfriend had the special alaskan halibut that was caught and flown in same day and they loved it. Very well prepared, a great sauce, and good side veggies. My dad and I had a parmesean encrusted tilapia that was also incredible with a great sauce and arugula and veggies on top. Both dishes were amazing! To top it off, we ordered the bananas foster bread pudding. Now my dad is a bread pudding conoisseur, and he said it was the best he has ever had. Now that really says a lot because he was ordered bread pudding the world over. So I dont know how all these bad reviews came about, but our dinner was spectacular. Service was very good too.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They offer a unique and flavorful menu, and anyone that's ever waited on us has been very friendly and attentive. They bring a basket of a few different kinds of bread, with a great olive oil/vinegar dipping sauce. The bread is always soft, fresh, and tastes great. Salad is always good, and I'm a big fan of their soups. One of the last times we were there, our waiter was mentioning soups to us, and I had said that I never liked tomato soup. He insisted that I had to try theirs. He went beyond that, and brought us a sample of BOTH of their soups. The tomato, and a blue cheese-celery soup. I'm also not a big fan of blue cheese (actually, I hate it) and thought the combination sounded horrible. But I tried both of these samples since he was so kind to bring them out, and it actually changed my mind about both. I realized, I had just never had GOOD tomato soup before. Definitely try the blue cheese celery, it sounds odd, but it really is good. I've had some of the pasta, and the last time I was there I had a curried lentil (or vegetable) soup. Can't remember which, but it was AMAZING, if you like curry....get it. It's my favorite soup now. Also their desserts are to die for.

With a bit of teriyaki/hoisin sauce. This is a staple for Hawaiians!Firecracker and Spicy Hulk rolls - these were outstanding! Huge rolls, very fresh and full of flavor, and beautifully presented.Korean Fried Chicken - half spicy and half soy garlic. The chicken is on point, with a delicious crispy coating. I preferred the spicy, the soy garlic has a bit of sweetness, (and I'm more spicy than sweet), I'll ask for it to be even spicier next time as it was still pretty mild to me.

I raved to my family that their food last time was good but service lacked. They agreed to Umami and after their 1st visit, they will never return. The owner asked, how many? I stated \"8\", her reaction seemed \"bothered\" and asked if I had a reservation, we did not, as this was a last minute decision. We were seated promptly and our waiter Michael, took our drink orders. Shortly thereafter our dinner order. Items ordered:Calamri: was not cooked all the way, it was still very jelly likeGyoza: typical & edibleSpam Musubi  - good portion for $5 but was covered in teriyaki/hoisin sauce which overpowered the spam, rice, and one strip of seaweed wrap. (2nd piece never got touched). 2 orders of beef Bibimbap - the menu states it has \"side dishes\", the only side dish it comes with is a small plate of kimchi, which we had to remind the staff of as well as the \"served with miso soup\", which both came out long after our entrees were served. Beef Miso Ramen - too small of a bowl for ramen. Typically it's delivered in a large bowl, where you have room to stir or mix without your food or broth overflowing. The soup was still hot and the noodles, veggies, and beef were good but the miso broth was too sweet. No condiments offered or on the table. I took 5 bites and the rest went to waste.Chicken fried rice: nothing special Stir Fry Udon - udon noodles were overcookedSushi Special - last item delivered to our table after some had already finished their meals. Also the menu states it comes with Nigiri sushi but sashimi came out instead. ***We were over it at this point and did not bother to try to have them correct the order.Cocktails and beer were ordered as well, which we were delayed coming out. I would like to add that we had to ask for menu's, napkins (which we never got the entire 2 hours we were there), silverware, soy sauce for the sushi, sides, soups, and salads that were to be served prior to our entrees (we received them afterward).The food is okay but not worth the frustration that comes along with your meal. Our server Michael, was very nice but I think it is an overall management issue.Sorry no pictures were taken as we were all starving by the time the food was served.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I decided to go to Umami because I wanted to branch out and try to find more good sushi places in Nashville. Everyone knows about the higher end places like Wild Ginger and Virago, but I want to find more mid-level places to grab sushi in town. Overall, I'd say Umami was pretty good. Umami isn't just a sushi place. They pride themselves in having dishes from many different Asian countries. There were a number of dishes that looked really good. My wife and I decided to split some sushi and Thai to try to get some variety in our experience. On the sushi side we split the Umami roll. I have to say that this roll was really good! I'd love to try some of their other rolls, especially their standard $5-$7 rolls. There were a bunch of specialty rolls that looked really good as well. I think if I go back we'll try a few different rolls. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao. It was tasty and a really great size. At $10 I'd say that's a pretty good deal. It's very flavorful and I really liked the rice noodles. Like I said, I'd like to go back and try some more of their sushi rolls. The vibe is a little off to me - lots of neon going on. Also there is a hand washing station outside the bathrooms but in the eating area. We happened to be sitting right next to this and couldn't help but laughing at how odd it wa a Giving this place 3 stars: solid food, nice service, ok vibe.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This is literally a one stop shop of some of the best Asian cuisines. Japanese? Korean? Thai? Yes. Yes. And yes. My sister and I sat at the bar and ordered the Korean fried chicken, hoedeopbap, titan roll and nemo roll. The Korean fried chicken are some of the best I've had. Though We got the spicy option,  it wasn't as spicy as I'd hope, however the owner said they could definitely make it spicier for us. Totally accommodating, I love it! Side note, if you plan to order these, be sure to order these first and early on bc they take a while to make. But it's worth the wait. The crispness of the skin and juiciness of the chicken is to die for. The hoedeopbap is a bowl of rice with assorted raw fish, cucumbers, lettuce, and carrots with a side of spicy sauce. Warning. The bowl is HUGE! This is definitely a meal in itself. It's a very light and refreshing bowl. We had to take most of this home since we were too stuffed on everything else. The titan roll and Nemo roll were both delicious rolls packed with flavors. Again, these rolls are also huge so be prepared to take two bites or stuff it all in one, either way, you won't be disappointed. Aside from the huge projected tv screen on the wall, one of the other many cool parts of this modern restaurant is that they have a sauce bar. All the sauces you can imagine. I'm a sucker for a good dipping sauce so instead of constantly bugging my waiter/waitress, I definitely do not mind being able to make my own concoction. The owner, Michelle, was a pleasure to talk to. Her suggestions were on point and I look forward to my many visits there. Dessert is a must the next time I come!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Umami is a newly opened pan-Asian restaurant serving authentic Japanese, Korean and Thai food. I live in Chicago, but I go to Nashville often to visit family and friends (I stayed in Brentwood area), so it was nice timing for me to try out this new restaurant and I got to try a lot of their menu items with our group. They've got a great variety of dishes on their menu, and everything we had was delicious. You can tell that everything is made from scratch here, as well as using fresh, authentic ingredients. Here's my review on each item, in no particular order:Kimchi fries: This is a fun take using a Korean classic (the kimchi) and an American snack (cheese fries). I loved all the flavors and textures on this dish: crispy hot french fries topped with ooey, gooey nacho cheese, sauteed kimchi, scallions, and a white sauce that I can only guess is mayo (or sour cream?). I will try to update this when I find out. Korean Fried Chicken: One of their more popular items (according to our server). You can select the soy garlic or the spicy sauce, or go half and half with your order (6 pcs, 10 pcs, 20 pcs, 30 pcs). I wanted my son to be able to try it, so I opted for the soy garlic. That did NOT disappoint! It's the perfect blend of that umami flavor that comes from soy sauce paired with the garlic flavor. It comes with a side of pickled radishes that is the perfect complementary crunch with your chicken. This is actually how fried chicken is served in Korea, and it's excellent. No need to travel all the way to Seoul!Tuna poke: this is your classic tuna poke (pronouned poh-kae), which is a salad of raw tuna, cucumber and avocados. There were large chunks of fresh tuna, marinated and seasoned well (not overpowering the tuna or anything). Speaking of fresh...can't get any fresher with the sashimi plate! We got a variety of sashimi to share, and I seriously loved every type of fish! If you're adventurous, you can try the freshly fried shrimp head if you order the sweet shrimp sashimi. The kitchen basically deep-fries the actual shrimp head that's taken off the body of the raw shrimp. For some of you, that sounds like something that could be shown on Andrew Zimmern's show, Bizarre Foods. But like he says on his show...if it looks good, eat it!!!!!!! Ahng!!!!! Mango Tango Maki Roll: one of the recommendations from our server -- did not disappoint! I asked for this roll without cream cheese (I just do not prefer to have any cream cheese in any of my rolls) and it was not even an issue (I mention this, because some restaurants don't like to customize the maki roll orders -- \"no substitutes\" policy at those places). I don't think I've ever had a \"sweet\" maki roll before, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavors of this roll. The spicy crab and mango/strawberry actually went really well together. I'm glad that they can be inventive with their maki rolls, as well as serve the usual crowd favorites. Side note: I love the fun names of the maki rolls -- ranging from \"Pokemon Go\", \"Music City\", and \"the \"OMG Roll\" (I imagine this one will make you say OMG haha)Korean Chicken Tacos: You can choose from beef, chicken or pork for the Korean tacos. My son loves chicken, so we just went with the safer option (still delicious). I guess we could have tried the combo, I think that comes with one of each taco, maybe? This is also a very fun take on some classic Korean flavors with a little Mexican twist: the chicken has a Korean marinade, topped with Asian pickled radishes and cilantro, served in a warm corn tortilla.Seafood Ramen: If you're familiar with and (like me) LOVE the Chinese-Korean noodle dish called \"Jjam-bbong\", then you will equally fall in love with this dish! The noodles are obviously the ramen noodles, but in the spicy seafood broth that is used for the \"jjam-bbong\" dish. I can tell that they use fresh seafood for the broth, because it's spicy and refreshing, not fishy at all! I was actually thinking about this bowl the next day...and how much I wanted to eat it again. The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back to get this dish again!Beer Selection: They have an AWESOME beer selection, with some local and international beers. I love checking out local beers wherever I go, and the ones I tried were awesome. They also have some great ones on tap. Fun tip: Order a large pitcher of beer, and it comes out in this REALLY fun pitcher that has dry ice and flashing lights -- so flashing smoke from your pitcher. It's not just for funsies, though...it keeps your beer nice and cold so that every pour is just as refreshing as the first.I saw a lot of people coming in for pick-up orders, so if you don't have time to sit down in the restaurant, you could always call ahead and pick up on your way home (or wherever you're headed).Overall, a wonderful meal and experience at Umami. Keep it up, guys! I'll be coming back soon.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The owners have refinished and redone a lot for a modern upgrade.My girlfriend and I ordered the beef ramen and the chicken Pad Thai. Both were so delicious and everything is made from scratch here. There is a sauce and spice bar that you can visit at your pleasure and doctor your food up however you please. I certainly enjoy that because I like spice.  Their beer selection is huge and they have wine and sake as well. They also have a few beers on tap. The wine by the glass is a little high for what we got.. $10.00.. but the owner did say they have happy hour from 4:00-7:00 PM. (and who doesn't love a good happy hour?)The service was great! The owner was so sweet and happily helped with anything she needed too as well as spoke with us about the building itself and their background. I'm excited to come back and try something new! *Make sure you check in when you come here as well. We received a free egg roll on the house when I did!

(I got a Philly roll and a Yellowtail roll for my meal, because I was in a sushi mood.) Want Korean fried chicken? They've got it. (My fiance ordered this and loved it.) Want other Korean dishes, including Bibimbap, Bulgogi, Kimchi Fried Rice? They've got it. Korean Tacos? They've got it? Thai classics like Pad Thai and Red Curry? They've got it. Ramen? They've got it. Udon? They've got it. Teriyaki dishes? They've got it. Unless you're dining with someone that has a blanket dislike of Asian foods and cuisines (who is this person?), everyone can find something to eat at Umami. Other good things about it? Beers on tap include a couple of local/TN options (I had Mill Creek Lil' Darling), and the beers come in a mason jar (not sure if that's really a selling point but there it is). The service was good. They have an ENORMOUS TV on one wall, so we were able to enjoy our sushi and fried chicken while watching Monday Night Football. It's pretty big and pretty modern. We couldn't believe how empty it was, given the quality of the food and the service. We'll be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was super excited but nervous since most mixed Asian food places aren't that great, but I was very happy when I left!  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating with my sister and I's allergies (peanuts, shellfish). The service was a tiny bit slow, but they were slammed and we could tell they were doing their best, so no worries there. One of the hostesses was playing an acoustic set in between hostessing. My sister got the \"Hot Chick\" roll with no avocado or shrimp (had to do chicken since she can't have shellfish!), and I got \"The Hulk\" I think it was? Something about The Hulk. The sushi was AMAZING and so flavorful. I like the simple nigiri but love creative sushi places. Definitely one of my favorites now. We also split red curry after that. They asked if we wanted extra rice at no charge. So nice! I ordered the red curry with medium heat and it was perfect. My sister thought it was a little too spicy for her, but she's pretty sensitive to spicy foods. She still thought it was delicious no doubt. All the dishes around us looked good too so now I want to try everything! I live in Lenox Village so I will definitely be back very soon, and frequently! I actually like it better than Sushime.

    "comments": "Finally... a place that can pull of Korean food in the Nolensville/Lennox Village area! I have been to Umami twice now and both times the food was fantastic. For our first dinner there, we ordered a small portion of the Korean Fried Chicken (spicy). The chicken was so crispy and flavorful. In fact, I would venture out to say that most of the hot chicken joints could take a lesson from Umami on crispy chicken. A must try! For our main courses we had the Bibimbap and beef Bulgogi. Both were fantastic, especially the bulgogi. The mix of side dishes were a nice touch, and the kimchi is perfection. We finished the meal with mango sticky rice and left excited to come back.Our next visit was lunch. We had the Korean tacos which were served with the bulgogi meat, pickled radish, onion, cilantro, and spicy sauce. They were amazing, messy, but amazing. If you love Korean food, you have to give Umami to your list. I'm sure their sushi, Thai, and Japanese dishes are good too, but when the chef is Korean, K-pop is playing, and Korean is the biggest portion of the menu, you gotta do it right!

    "comments": "I think it's a dangerous proposition to offer so many different types of Asian cuisine under one roof. I naturally think it's going to be a lot of mediocre options instead of one very good thing.I asked the waitress what she recommended or what their specialty was. She threw out a few of their popular roles and mentioned a few other things including their Korean fried chicken. I got their Ramen knowing full well that it wouldn't compare to what I have had so my expectations were where they needed to be. It was decent. The noodles were nice and firm and the egg was great. The broth lacked the creamy richness that a specialty ramen place in Little Tokyo would have. My friend got the bimbimbap and we shared a mix of the spicy and soy chicken.Why 5 stars? Their amazing Korean Fried Chicken!  We ended up talking to the owner and her Korean husband is the chef so there you go! This chicken is authentic and awesome. Crispy but ooey gooey in spicy sweet sauce. In a town known for its love for hot chicken, I feel like this place should forget everything else and just be a Korea meets Nashville chicken place! Go check it out and get yourself some chicken!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "It says a lot about a restaurant when I'm willing to take the time to create a Yelp account solely to say how horrible they are. To begin with, their customer service is horrid. They act like they're doing you a favor by letting you place an order. While trying to place a phone order this week, not only did the owner completely interrupt but then she said \"I have someone trying to pay and we are very busy\". (For the record, she had five tables. The restaurant was 2/3 empty). To make matters worse, they totally ripped off some of the previous restaurant's menu. Sushime used to be the sushi place in Lenox. Umami may have been able to keep the sushi dude from Sushime, but the teeny tiny changes they made to the rolls ruin the awesomeness that was Sushime. I'm not sure why tacos and Korean BBQ and sushi and sweet potato fries are all on the same menu. It's like they wanted to just cover all their bases. They installed a massive refrigerator with bottles of beer, and removed the sushi bar (which was a highlight of the previous owners). If you want sweet potato fries and good beer, go to Burger Republic. If you want good sushi, go across the street. This place is a waste of time. Oh! Fun bonus fact? The owner, when I met her the first time, spent a solid 10 minutes telling me how much money they sunk into their remodel and trash talking the previous sushi restaurant. That's tacky.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The food is absolutely amazing! The ambiance when sitting in the restaurant is progressive with the lights that swirl above you on the ceiling. The menu caters to all palettes to cure your every hope in an asian cuisine restaurant. Among the vast amount of drinks available you will find something to quench your thirst and if not they offer you a large carafe of personal water for your table. Despite all of these wonderful things what I would really like to talk about is the service.     Michelle and Steve from day one have always treated my family as their very own. Michelle has taken time every time we are in to share the design and the understanding of the food selections on the menu. She really goes the extra mile for her guests.     Steve has a wonderful smile when he is able to be free of the kitchen. He is usually always in the back preparing the delightful food presentations that rest in front of everyone for their dining pleasure. My wife and I have found the design work of the garnishes to be as artistic as they are edible. They are very creative and healthy and crafted fresh. There is a real beauty in his work. The flavor of every meal is a real pleasure as it is also an adventure.      My wife and I love Umami! The real beauty of this hidden gem in Lenox is that Michelle and Steve really work hard to get to know their guests and always share the real thought behind their restaurant. The price is very reasonably priced. The love they show toward serving others and the flavors are worth every penny!      If you make it to the desserts; prepare to fall in love with the ending of your meal. I highly recommend eating here and getting to know and love the owners. The whole experience for us has been a real treasure at Umami. We will always be regulars there as they have treated us so well since day one.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

If the food weren't great I wouldn't come back here because the service isn't worth it. They seem to not have enough people working there to keep up with all of the people and orders. On a more positive note, their sushi is some of the best I've had. (Pokémon Go roll is addictive.) Their beef Korean tacos are delicious and huge.

We ordered KFC, poke, some sushi, ramen, and one Korean beef dish.KFC - just ok;Poke - fresh but very small portion, like, very small;Sushi - standard; Ramen - not the real ramen. The broth is just soy sauce( like the ones you can make at home for less than $1) not the authentic broth that takes a long time to make;Korean beef dish - ok, you can taste a lot of sugar.Over all the fool is just ok. Restaurants want to focus on too many things may not always be a good thing. The worst part is, everything is very over priced. I think they should only charge 60% of it will be more reasonable. Maybe because the rent is high or something but the food was definitely not worth the price. Service was ok, but I can already see if they are busy they probably can't  handle it just like most of the Asian restaurants around. Not going back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I wanted to like this place more than I did. First the atmosphere - I did like the clean, open and modern feel. I did not use the restrooms but I noticed a long vanity with two sinks along one wall in the dining area that was very unusual and a little uncomfortable feeling and must admit I don't like it.I tried several dishes to get a feel and satisfy my cravings that night. I started out with the fried calamari. In an Asian restaurant I pretty much expect this to be a tempura batter or at least panko. These looked like the typical pre-breaded frozen calamari rings you can buy in the grocery and they pretty much tasted as much. Not particularly fresh and just a hit of toughness that comes from not being fresh or slightly overcooked.Next was the shrimp tempura. This was just ok. The only thing that kept it from being good to great was was such a small thing but the whole difference. The tempura batter was not cooked enough or the oil temp was not hot enough when they were dropped.It was soft, but not soggy, instead of crispy.My biggest disappointment came in the Korean fried chicken wings. I wanted to try both sauces but on the side for several reasons. I wanted to taste them plain. I knew something would be going home with me and probably some of these and the calamari rather than the tempura so if they weren't sauced, they would reheat and crisp up better. And because I wasn't sure of which sauce I would prefer. I was told that they cannot send them out plain because they can't finish the dish that way. Well finish the dish out must have meant sprinkle the sesame seed on top of the sticky sauce coated wings and have it stick. I was not crazy about either sauce and particularly disappointed that they both had a good bit of sugar in them as I am diabetic and it's just something not needed to make the sauces good. And since I did take most of them home, they were soggy and did not crisp back up with reheating. I also asked them if their crust was gluten free and the waitress could not answer me nor the hostess but she said they could make it gluten free. That sort of made me uncomfortable with bringing my friend that truly has celiac here. We had another place that made all of their kfc and sauces gluten free.Overall it was an okay experience but not good enough that I really want to go back. There are several places that do these dishes well nearby though they don't all try to attempt so many different Asian styles under one roof.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We were so excited to eat here. The restaurant that was here before this place was Sushi Me, and that was our favorite spot. We were welcomed right away by the new owner when we arrived. She was very kind and informed us that they still have the same sushi chef that Sushi Me had. Greatest news ever to us! I will say, everything we ordered was amazing! Some of the greatest sushi in Nashville, in our opinion. However, the waitress we were given is one of the worst waitresses we have ever had in our lives. By checking in there for the first time on Yelp, you can claim a free egg roll. So we ordered that soon after arriving. And then we placed our drink orders and sushi order. We had to repeat the sushi order 3 times. She wasn't even familiar with the menu. I ordered moscato. I had to show it to her on the menu because she didn't know what that was! Same with the beer order. It wasn't a lack of understanding us at all, it's like she has never heard of any item from their menu. We sat there for at least 30 minutes with no drinks and no egg roll. I noticed that our drinks had been sitting up on the bar ready for her to bring to us. This waitress was running around appearing to be messing up other customers' tickets and orders. She kept having to get the manager. Her other tables (maybe 2 other tables) looked very aggravated, as we did. I was almost to the point of going up to the bar and getting our drinks. We finally caught her attention and asked about our drinks. She had definitely forgot and went to go get them. I asked about the egg roll. She forgot about that too, and never put the order in. She assured it would be out soon. The place was busy so we had to wait longer than usual for our sushi, but that was understandable. Finally, our sushi arrived. But no egg roll. I asked if we could have that too. She forgot. She assured it would be out soon. I will say again, the sushi was delicious! We finished all 4 rolls and finished our drinks. The waitress never once came to check on us and see if we needed anything. We finally caught her attention after sitting there for quite awhile with our empty plates and glasses, and we told her we were ready for the check and that egg roll. She forgot. She asked if maybe we could just get our egg roll next time. Are you kidding me?! I said, no we ordered it over an hour ago. We want it now. We actually wanted it before our meal. She just walked away. About another 10 minutes later she comes out with the ticket and the egg roll. In the meantime, one of her other 2 tables was getting irritated and went up to owner asking for their ticket. She never said thank you to us or sorry for our long wait or anything. In conclusion, this waitress made our experience here terrible. We wasted a lot of our Friday night sitting and waiting to be served. It was ridiculous. We definitely want to come back here because we are in love with the quality of the food. And we liked the atmosphere. But if we are ever given this waitress again we will demand a different one. All of the other waiters and waitresses seemed to be doing an excellent job. But this place is going to continue to have angry customers if they don't do something about this horrible waitress. We weren't the only ones unhappy last night.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Well, the vegetables were anemic and wilted and sparse, the tofu was mushy with absolutely no seasoning, there was no extra chili paste, and there was half (so weird) a fried egg thrown on top. Also, it was supposed to come with miso soup and sides, of which I got none. I am so disappointed because I love Korean food and I was looking forward to having a Korean restaurant nearby.

Miso soup was on point, as was the Umami roll. The Thai red curry is a big bowl of comfort, like a warm hug from the inside out. The spice in the curry was just right--warm enough to make the mouth tingle, but not so hot that it was uncomfortable. Everyone in the group loved their food and we are glad we have leftovers for lunch. Definitely a win and will be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

After my husband and I were seated (he came a few minutes after me), someone finally came along after about 25 minutes to take our order. Meanwhile we were \"entertained\" by K-pop boyband videos playing on an enormous, in-your-face screen. Adding to our overloaded sensory experience, additional tvs were tuned to a NASCAR car race, an OU football game and the Big Bang theory. Finally, after another 20-25 minutes, we got our food and it was ok - not great, not bad - but I've had much better bulgogi on the west coast (and at home, for that matter).  The menu said it was bulgogi with vegetables, and the veggies consisted of shredded scallions and a bit of cooked white onions. Hubby said his Thai curry was pretty good. Not great, but good. We finally got our check after being there well over an hour and a half. Hopefully for their sake, this was an off night. Although the food was ok, I don't plan to go back.

After waiting over 40 minutes and inquiring about our food multiple times, we finally rec'd one of the two appetizers, quickly followed by my husband's entree (within 5 minutes). 15 minutes later we had still not rec'd the other appetizer or my entree. I canceled the rest of our order and asked for the check. I spoke with the manager directly and was offered a half hearted apology and she asked me if I wanted my meal comped, as if that was my agenda for complaining. Very rude. I declined and stated that my intention was to make her aware of our experience so that she could address whatever issues led to our bad experience. Her response was simply to say that everyone came at the same time. Umm, ok?? The place was emptying out at this point. Very frustrating because the food we tried was good and I was excited to have a new Thai option close to home. I normally try a new restaurant at least twice before forming an opinion much less writing a bad review, but once was enough for me in this case. Bad service just doesn't cut it, particularly coming from an owner.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Tickets went on sale Monday at 9am before the Friday show we were trying for.  Both my husband and I were on our computers ready to purchase.  He got stuck in the queuing system they use but I got in and was able to snag tickets for us for the later show.  We felt super lucky about this after speaking to Uber drivers, hotel staff, and locals we met at bars over the weekend who all explained how hard the tickets are to get and many tourists don't actually get to go see a show.  If you are going to Nashville definitely make the effort to try to get tickets.  If you don't...cry. I would have gone here each of our three nights.  The venue is in a strip mall and a short drive from downtown, but don't let that turn you away! The Bluebird has such charm (especially if yo you know anything about it's history and the people that have played here) - its cozy and very intimate.  There isn't a bad seat in the house as all the tables surround the musicians.  We saw five singer/song writers (including Emily Reid and the Stellas - both amazing) play in the round for about 2.5 hours.  Incredible night.  Go to the Bluebird!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I knew I wanted to make it here when I booked my first Nashville trip, and we even planned to go on a Monday night knowing that a weekend night would be pretty much impossible to get in. I had read online how the first Monday show is open mic and thought that'd be more interesting than the later show, which was a local band we wouldn't have known. We like a mix of music so hearing severalMusicians would've been right up our alley. We planned to get there by 4:30 after reading the reviews about how the line starts early. A huge thunderstorm rolled in right around 4 and it made driving through downtown a mess. We ended up getting there around 5 and the line was already almost down to the end of the plaza. Shortly after getting in line, one of the workers came out and told us where the cutoff point was and that we weren't making it. We got out of line because we weren't going to wait around until 9 for the next show--like most tourists, we had a few other things we were hoping to do before we left town since this didn't work out. I know that half of the appeal of the Bluebird is that it's small and has remained traditional and unchanged over the years, but it kind of stinks for people who only have so much time to spend in Nashville and then find a way out to the Bluebird, since it's not near downtown, just to be turned away. Again, we would've bought tickets ahead of time to guarantee our entry if we could have. I feel like they should know the place will be drawing a crowd regardless of the day of the week, so it wouldn't hurt to add on presales to all days so that people don't have to get turned away. I'd try again on a future visit, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a tad bummed this time around.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The venue is so small and intimate, and realizing just how many amazing artists got their start here is unbelievable. Yes, it's difficult to get tickets. We didn't get tickets so we showed up an hour and a half early and got in without a problem. The first 8 in line get seats at the bar and then next 10-12 get church style pew seats. From what I gathered, there is no cover charge for these seats during the early show, just a $7/person food & drink minimum. Honestly I can't speak to the food because I didn't eat it, but no one goes for the food. Do yourself a favor and make the extra effort to get in here. It's worth the trouble.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Bluebird is definitely a must for any fans of the show Nashville. Although a very small music venue in a random Green Hills shopping center it is amazing inside. It is a listening room, so it is meant to enjoy the music not to carry on any conversations after the music starts.My friend and I got tickets on a weeknight for 'In the Round' where songwriters/musicians sit in a circle in the middle of the room and take turns playing original music. Although it was free to reserve the tickets online it was a $15 cover the night we went and they require all patrons to purchase one item (my friend and I ordered wine). Tickets are available at 8 am exactly one week in advance from the date you are planning to go. You can expect that any given night may sell out in minutes, especially if it's someone well known. It's possible to show up the night of to get one of their few seats for first come, first serve but you would need to show up pretty early to do so. Overall great experience and I highly recommend it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We had a great time here last night.  We made reservations the morning they opened up for our date, and had great seats in the first row near the stage though they were off to the side.  We were surprised in the suburban strip mall location of the venue, but it did make parking easier.The cafe is quite small and intimate. They do a good job of warning people to stay quiet during the performance (which is crucial in small places like this) and the crowd complied nicely.  The acoustics were fine.The four singer-songwriters took turns performing some of the older more successful tunes, and some of their newer material.  Some of them were better writers, some better singers, but they were all very talented.The wait staff was unobtrusive and efficient taking orders and delivering libations and food.  The prices were not ugly, and the food was pretty good for a bar.  I had a BLT, and it was pretty tasty.What we walked away with was a feeling that we had participated in something that wasn't quite so commercial as other music opportunities in Nashville.  Yes, these musicians are in it to make a living, but clearly their passion for their art came through in the inter-song patter.  We would definitely return!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Unfortunately I was not able to secure tickets to a show but I was able to get on a Nashville TV Show inspired tour which took us to The Bluebird prior to it's opening one night. It was amazing walking in, I felt like I was on the show. They did an amazing job in replication. Hearing the history from the owners was such a treat, the place has started the careers of so many, the concept is amazing! I hope to come back into town and get to see a show but even walking in and seeing it was a great experience!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I stood outside for 15 minutes waiting for an uber out of there and the music I heard through the glass was garbage anyway. Most groups on broadway blow them away.

How is this even possible if I was right in at exactly the time they said while my mom and sis are still in the queue.  Doesn't seem they make everything available.  I selected and then when my mom and sis got in they got sold out.  I sent them an email saying to cancel the reservation I made and that I'm sorry that because of their system we wouldn't be able to check out their place during our visit.  They wrote back -                                    Thank you for reaching out to us. We are happy to assist with the cancellation of your reservations. Please remember that we are unable to refund the amount you were charged at the time of your reservations (Service Fees, Taxes, or Pre-Pays) but you should not see any additional charges in regards to your cancelled seats.Awesome, so not only am I out of luck but you also charged me $3 to even try to reserve for a free concert.  What the hell?  People talked about pretentious - I think that is a perfect word for this place.  Get over yourself Bluebird Cafe.  We will likely enjoy great music at better places in Nashville.Oh and thanks for making me wake up super early and ruin my Monday morning!  Not like you care one bit.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was such a great experience! The setting is very intimate, and the music was great! We did not try any of the food, as we had pew seats, but did have a couple of drinks, which were nothing to write home about; and quite expensive. Don't come here for the food or drink though, come for the music. Inside you can see pictures of many greats who have played there in the past, and it just feels like a special place. I cannot wait to go again! Oh, and one last thing, get all of your talking out before the music begins, as there is a SHHHH !policy that they are pretty serious about.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Seating is kind of communal so you get to know the people around you and have a good conversation. Full bar, and food is simple but really good.

I love places like this because it's not what you think from the outside.  From the outside it just looks like a taco shop back in San Diego that has like 4 tables.  But it seats about 70 at a strip mall.  How's that for not judging a bird by it's bird cage?!      This is where the magic happens. I luv being around artist who are paying their dues and trying to make it. This place is so legendary they don't take reservations and they pack in all the time for Songwriters Nights. There's a wall of a lot of people who have played there. This is where the \"Songwriters\" perform who wrote and created hits for other artist and themselves . Everyone from Taylor Swift, Keith Urban, Faith Hill and omg Carol KING!!! Carol King played here. \"gasp!\" So awesome. And now Mel M from Yelp has took a pic in front of the entrance at the Bluebird Cafe =)  If you're into Country and or love music and always wanted to visit Nashville.  You will want to stop here for street cred.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I loved the impromptu songs and that family members were in the audience. It was great to talk to the songwriters after the show. What fantastic people! The wait staff was awesome. At times, the banter between performances was about awkward, but mostly it was humorous. The food is okay. I wouldn't come hungry. And beware, if you come to the later show they will sell out of popular food items. Also, be prepared to wait two hours plus in the scorching, humid heat before the show. It's definitely worth it, but definitely adds a particular smell to the experience. Overall, go here! Come really early. Eat a big meal before/after.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had never heard of the names of the people performing but after leaving, I will own some of their CDs now!Cover charge at the door and a $7 minimum inside. It's easy to spend $7 by simply ordering a drink. The oven was broken the night I went, but they still had some food options available too. I wouldn't say it's worth eating here, especially if you are visiting from out of town. Nothing on their menu is worth while. The music and performances make this place great.

I was a little worried beforehand that we wouldn't get there in time and make the cut. But luckily we got there about an hour and 15 minutes early and got a spot in line. I believe we were around number 50 at that point and good thing because they were only allowing in 75.As others have said you don't come here for the food, not that I can speak to it as we didn't order any. But what seemed to be coming out of the kitchen were some simple sandwiches and your standard fare of fried snacks. Since there is no cover charge or tickets they asked that we spend at least $7 on food/drink which was easy enough to do with a glass of wine.It is very intimate inside and we got the last two seats in the place together at the bar. Everyone else's party had to split up into single seats situated throughout. But that doesn't seem to matter too much as you're there to listen to the music and not socialize. I thought all of the writers/performers of the evening were fantastic (probably because they have to audition to even perform there). It was a great way to hear some new and upcoming music.

The day of our visit they were doing a \"in the round\" so instead of a stage the performers  were set up in a circle in the middle of the room that made for a really intimate feel. It kinda felt like they were just hanging out and singing and we got to watch. There was some awesome original country music happening and I'm glad I got to be a part of it. There is a minimum order you have to make but it's no different than like a comedy club. One appetizer and drink later I was well over the minimum. The only thing that disappointed me was that the artist weren't allowed to use like square readers for people to buy their music. I never carry cash so I just ended up buying stuff on iTunes later.

    "comments": "Oh gosh, if you really had just one day in Nashville, where would you go that evening for live music, the Grand Ole Opry or the Bluebird Cafe? That's a tough call, but since neither Jamie W. nor I have ever been to Nashville before, we went with the Opry with no regrets. An excellent concert that turned out to be the pinnacle of time management as the show was done at 9:15PM sharp. Did we dare try to traverse the city for a half-hour to attempt to catch the 9:30PM show at the Bluebird? Why not, what did we have to lose? After all, we were leaving town in the morning.So off we went to discover that the Bluebird Cafe is in a strip mall off Hillsboro Pike. Like Joseph and Mary in baseball caps, we were hoping there could be room for us. We wouldn't have minded standing next to the restroom, but alas, there was a handwritten sign taped on the glass door that said no one else would be allowed in since they were sold out. It reminded me of that scene in \"Hans Christian Andersen\" when Danny Kaye got locked in the closet by Farley Granger, an ironic point since both actors were in the Hollywood celluloid closet if you know what I mean. Danny was put in the closet to prevent him from giving the slippers to his beloved ballerina, the subject of his unrequited love.I didn't have any shoes on me to give to performer and well-regarded composer Gary Burr, but we were able to peek through the window and see a bit of his performance that night. The owners were kind enough to have speakers out into the parking lot (photo:  bit.ly/1IL4WQ4). I know who Burr is because he's now in a country trio with his wife and my old favorite Kenny Loggins. \"Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya, honey.\" Burr has an almost-as-pleasing voice. All we needed were a couple of naugahyde recliners from Bradford's Furniture next door except they were closed. Too bad there was an agitated guy on his cell thoroughly upset that he couldn't get in. Chill bro, this is Nashville. Good music is everywhere.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Since Monday was a holiday, there was only one that weekend, and everyone had the idea to go early. I got to the Bluebird at 5:30 PM and was one of the last to make it in for the 8 PM show (even though during the initial count, I was #60 -- I think people saved a lot of spots for their friends to jump in later and the performers also had some guests). The wait was pretty long and hot, and there was no shade so bring a fan and parasol and something to do! I'm sure most nights aren't quite as bad.That being said, the wait was worth it -- especially for 3.5 hours of music and stories. The Bluebird is truly a songwriter's venue. Steve Goodie was a hilarious host, setting the stage well and even performing the most hilarious song. All 8 or so performers were good singers... but truly amazing songwriters. I felt so many emotions that night from writers of diverse experiences, ages, and hometowns.Just as I thought the show was over, they bring on a featured songwriter -- Don Schlitz! He was gracious enough to entertain us for hours with hilarious stories and songs he wrote, including \"The Gambler,\" \"Forever and Ever, Amen,\" \"When You Say Nothing At All,\" \"You Can't Make Old Friends,\" among others that the crowd sang along to together.The inside is rather crowded, and I would strongly recommend against getting the garden salad (veggies were plain and chicken was nasty). I would gladly pay $7 and a couple hours of waiting for one of the most memorable musical experiences!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were just happy to have scored reservations while in Nashville.I do think it's important to arrive early whether you have a reservation or not. We had reserved pew seats, but requested table seats (if any were available after all the reservations were seated), and sure enough, we got to move up to a table. Much better than those uncomfortable pews!The venue is tiny and seating is extremely tight. We shared a table with two other couples. The kitchen burned my quesadillas twice, so I strongly advise eating somewhere else beforehand. I can't imagine anyone comes to the Bluebird for their food anyway. My best advice for the Bluebird is to keep your expectations in check!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

If you don't get in you can wait in line to step in the entrance and take pictures. It was awesome, a must-do, but it takes planing and time! If you get there past 4:15 your chances of getting in are slim. It is a very small, intimate venue. You are crammed in there. We didn't have a cover charge, but there was $7 minimum food/beverage charge. The menu is small but you should be able to find something. We ordered Mozzarella Breadsticks and Sweet Potato fries for an appetizer. They were both amazing! I would recommend the mozzarella breadsticks (only 3 of them, but they are big). I ordered the pork sandwich and chips. The pork was very tender but I like mine with a little more BQQ sauce. I was full I didn't even eat the chips. Music was great! We saw Kevin So.NOTE: just because you get in for the early show that doesn't meant you get to stay for the second show. They kick you out after and make you stand in line again. Basically there is no way to see both shows.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

On a Sunday, my 3 friends and I arrived at 5:40 and waited in line for the 8:00 show.  When we arrived, the staff assured my friends and I and several people behind us that we would definitely make it into the show.  On numerous times, the staff came out to assure my friends and people behind us that we would definitely make the show.  Their assurances were the reason why we took the time to wait for the show.  However, once it came time to get into the show, and after over a 2 hr wait, that was not the case.  The \"bouncer\" told us that only 1 person could get in from our group because they \"ran out of seating.\"  We were the first group to get turned away.  Suggestion: why not give everyone in line a ticket so people do not have to mindlessly wait?!  There were so many people who did not wait in line but still got through the door.  The \"bounder\" told us that he could let us in to take pictures and purchase merchandise.  So we waited.  From the door, we could hear the stand-up comedian.  I'm sorry, but isn't the Bluebird Cafe known for its music and not comedy?!  When the first act started, we could hear the music from the door the music was anti-climatic.  We were not impressed.  That's why we decided to not stick around even though we could hear the music outside the door.   After talking to my uber and lyft drivers about the Bluebird Cafe, they were not excited about the experience, I should have been warned about the experience.  They specifically said that Bluebird Cafe was only hyped up due to the show, but it's not worth the wait.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We reserved tickets online in advance and went in with an open mind. We knew nothing about the singer/songwriters when we got there but left feeling like we knew them. The place is very casual and intimate, and the songs and stories were beautiful. The only downside for me was a few songs were really sad and I lost my dad recently - I didn't see them coming (should have, its country music, lol) and I was a bit blubbery and embarrassed toward the end. Definitely evoked a lot of emotion, which is great when you're not so sensitive! Looking forward to going again, prepared with tissues in my purse next time!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Sadly I hadn't made a reservation beforehand, so I convinced my friend to take a chance on the no reservations show on Sunday. The Cafe, a 90-seat music club that opened in the early eighties, is famous for intimate, acoustic shows. Some performers are established singer/songwriters, and others perform hit songs written by other artists. We arrived about 45 minutes early for the show to a SUPER long line, but luckily we made it inside right before the cutoff (seriously -- we were numbers 88 and 89)!! There is no cover but there is a $7 food and drink minimum per person. I ordered a few beers. The food that I saw and tasted was nothing special. I'd eat beforehand and stick to drinks.The space really was intimate and people were nearly sitting on top of each other. Groups were sharing tables and some people were seated up against the walls. We were just a few rows back from the band, Two Story Road, a husband-wife duo with some amazing credentials. They played a mixture of covers and original songs and were pretty incredible.The shows are only an hour at The Bluebird, but it is for sure worth the wait. If you are going to Nashville I would see if there's a show you can buy tickets for ahead of time (I think they release them 1 week in advance and they sell out almost immediately). Otherwise, get there about an hour before and be prepared to wait for a great show!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Bluebird Cafe is an interesting place.  Famous for live music, Bluebird Cafe is great under the right circumstances.  The venue is entirely context dependent on which artists you see and whether or not your have reservations.First, if you want to visit Bluebird, get reservations.  It's a pain, I know, but it's the only way to go.  On the night we attended, about 90% of the venue was filled with reserved seats.  The remaining 10% went to the line outside, which was at least 50 people deep.  Needless to say, the vast majority were left out.The tight seating had one great side benefit.  I watched with glee as multiple people tried to sneak inside the building before being caught and escorted out.  The woman who \"wanted a quick picture\" suffered the same fate as the dude who \"just had to go to the bathroom\" - the host politely escorted them out and dropped them at the back of the line where they belonged.  It was the most entertaining part of the night for me!Our group had a reservation, so we were seated quickly.  We had a great view of the stage, and ordered some food and drinks.  I know that most people come to the Bluebird for the music, but the nominal per-person minimum makes food a small part of the experience.  I had a black bean burger that was excellent, but the rest of our table met with less success with the pork sandwich and other items.  The food was underwhelming, but again, that's not the big reason why you come, so it's a minor demerit.  The staff continued service during the performances, but it was more difficult to get the staff's attention (as you would expect).  My suggestion is to arrive and eat early, then sip a drink during the music.The reason people come to the Bluebird is to hear live music.  I've heard all of the legendary stories of epic performances in the \"listening room\" setting.  However, on the night I visited, the artists left something to be desired.  I don't want to criticize anyone who performs and puts themselves out there for others to listen to.  However, I will say that the group we saw was not up to the standard that I expected from the venue's reputation.  The other guests with me had visited the Bluebird multiple times, and all agreed that this was the worst performance they had seen.  Without going into specifics, the music was more juvenile than I expected, and the constant pandering to \"Nashville\" TV fame was extremely annoying.  I get it,  you're on the show... You don't need to remind me every 5 minutes!I read an article online that described happiness as someone's expectations minus her reality.  Under that framework, Bluebird Cafe didn't measure up on the night I went.  However, I would go back and hear a different set of artists perform.  To summarize, only visit if you have reservations, and hope that you hear a strong artist or two.  Without the good music, there's nothing to fall back on.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

That's when Bluebird cafe popped up on my yelp search.Situated randomly in a plaza (across from the Whole Foods and other stores), Bluebird cafe sits. We went on a rainy Sunday night for songwriters night, hosted by Steve Goodie. No reservations are taken for the night-it's a first come, first serve.We parked in the furniture store lot next door and walked over to stand in line. Almost two hours we stood and luckily, when the time came, the line started moving.. And the doors closed right behind us.  We were the last two people to get in for the night!We were seated in the pews in the back (most people got tables, but I think it's because we were the last ones) and were served right away. We got some local brews and nachos to share.. And sat back to listen.Steve Goodie is an awesome host- he's hilarious, musically talented, and full of charisma. And then the songwriters came up to stage- from young to old, to guitars to accordions, to singles to married folk, the range was endless. And it even ended with a famous songwriter (who wrote songs for Faith Hill, Keith Urban, etc) But overall, they were all solid and great. The crowd appreciated the music too (much different than what you see on Broadway) and it was just overall a great night. If you're looking for a chill place in Nashville to hear some great singers/songwriters and are willing to wait in line for it, definitely check out Bluebird Cafe- what a gem in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We roll up early the doors are locked and nobody to be found. Place doesn't open for another 2 hours.Then we find out they let the first 20 or so people waiting at the door in. We're the only ones there. We rode it out and I'm glad we did. FYI the wait list line started to build an hour before the doors open. By the time the door opened there were more people in the wait list line than could possibly fit into the club. Get there early. Real early if you want in. 4 musicians in the round.

    "comments": "You know what I really love? History. I love learning about what went down, where and with whom, and when I actually get to experience a part of it? Yeahhhh buddy. Bluebird Cafe opened in 1982, and since it's inception has been a source for songwriters to find exposure and fame. I'm a New Englander, now New Jerseyan. Although I can get down on some bluegrass or Americana style country (read Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson), I haven't ever really gotten down on country. And guess what? Bluebird Cafe isn't country. It's countryish, but it's more. It's rock, it's folk, it's acoustic, it's country, it's a lonely man pouring his heart out on a keyboard. It's magical!The Sunday night singer songwriter night was such an amazing experience, this review can't properly convey how much I enjoyed my time. You sit quietly as you laugh at the MC's hilarity and listen to some of the most talented people (did you know Taylor Swift was discovered on a Sunday night session at Bluebird Cafe?). This is where the real people (the people behind the people), who make music try out there stuff and have an opportunity to share. See, Taylor Swift, Tricia Yearwood, Mariah Carey, you name it - they all don't sing only the songs they write, they often sing songs that were created by others. Sunday night at the Bluebird Cafe is the others.Intimate, small, dark. It's a very cool experience if you love live music. Or, if you happen to be a fan of that new show Nashville, I guess the Bluebird Cafe is a reoccurring venue and you definitely see some hardcore fans.Read up on how to get tickets for any day of the week. For Sunday, you do have to wait in line, as reservations are nil.* Depending on the day, I hear sometimes you should probably get there hours before**. However you get 3 hours + of free live music and it's all good. They do ask that you spend at least $7 per seat and although the food is mostly bar food, grab a few beers and enjoy. Don't order the chocolate cake, or if you do, I warned you unless you like flavorless, stale cake.A wonderful experience for those who appreciate music and those who make it. It will be hard to top this wonderful experience. * I have some friends in high places who work in the biz and we were able to bypass that line.** Sunday night at the Bluebird Cafe is the most coveted time slot. I highly suggest attending this.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My wife, I and our wheelchair bound daughter went to the Bluebird for the first time last night for the Monday night \"Open Mic\".  Although we had the obligatory wait outside for over an hour before they opened, it was actually enjoyable and gave us a chance to speak with and hear the stories of musicians and others who had come from all over the United States and beyond to visit Nashville and the Bluebird. The Bluebird staff of Elliott, Britton, John and others were absolutely fantastic. They checked on us outside periodically and got us in out of the rain and seated as soon as they could. Although the small 85 seat room was packed, the service was very good, the drinks very reasonable and the beer extra cold.  We did not order any food, so can't speak to that.  There was no cover charge or minimum expenditure for the 6:00 open mic show, and the show was quite enjoyable - certainly can't beat that!  By the end of the night, we were on a first name basis with the staff and many others who were there.  Certainly an evening well spent. Highly recommend it to others.  Recommend that you do your research regarding the procedure for the night of the week you plan to go (as they all differ) and follow it carefully. Get reservations if you can and be sure to arrive extra early to be safe. Enjoy your memorable evening at the Bluebird and say hello to Elliott, Britton, John and the gang for us.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Went here last night, St. Paddy's day, they had two local singer/songwriters and then two from Belfast, Ireland. We were able to get reservations in advance, you can only get them a week in advance on-line. When you get there, there are two lines, one for folks with reservations, the other without. You have to check in, there's a staff member to do this. I noted there were around 20 people without reservations and they all got in, and even saw some additional stragglers seated later.  There will be a ten dollar cash cover and they want you to spend 7 bucks on either food or drink. Food ain't that great, don't come here to eat is my advice! Place is very small and intimate, maybe sits maximum 125-150 and it's cramped. The artists sit in the middle and take turns playing, they played almost two hours, but about a half hour was crowd banter I could have lived without. Perfect sound and acoustics. Now, some song writers should stick to writing and not singing, a wide variety of the quality of singing was displayed. Even better than listening was gleaming insight into the history and process of song writing, the localGuys had written some major hits for big stars and they didn't mind name dropping at all. Glad I was able to visit and experience this \"listening room\" experience. Anxious to give the Douglas Corner Cafe a try tonight!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Actually you may be waiting for 2 hours in the walk up line and not even get in the building. This information was not communicated well enough I thought. Also, the doors didn't open at 5:30pm. They opened at 6pm because everyone had to wait for the bartender to show up before people could go in.The music was quality.

    "comments": "Full disclosure- I'm one of those people who only found out about the Bluebird Cafe through the TV show \"Nashville,\" which has directly contributed to its skyrocketing in popularity. The history of this venue is remarkable. Countless famous artists played here when they were still unknowns, hoping to get discovered and signed by a record label. It's also common for prominent musicians to drop by and perform here, sometimes unannounced. In short, the Bluebird Café is LEGENDARY. Getting seats requires a bit of strategy and teamwork. Reservations are available Monday of the week of the show  at 8 AM sharp. They're very limited, and they go FAST. My friends and I employed a divide and conquer approach, hoping to maximize our chances. Only 1 in 4 of us got through. The website was impossibly slooooooooow . One guy was basically out within the first minute- his browser crashed. One girl decided to refresh the page because she wasn't seeing any progress. Never, ever refresh! It was down to me and one last guy, and alas, my wifi wasn't fast enough. The show was sold out within 7 minutes. There's a $2 online reservation fee, and a $7 minumum to spend on food/drink per seat. Some shows have a cover charge, but many are free. Don't give up if you didn't snag a seat. They hold a number of spots that are first-come-first-serve, so you can wait in line before each show  for those. I assure you, the effort is entirely worth it. This was one of the coolest things I've ever been blessed to experience, and I DON'T EVEN LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC (does Taylor Swift count? JK, don't hurt me). You don't have to be a fan of country music to appreciate the pure, unadulterated magic and raw talent at the Bluebird. We had the pleasure of enjoying a beautiful set from four writers, who have not only penned hits for recording artists, but are also gifted musicians who sing, compose, and play instruments. I felt so inferior in the best way possible. The café is cozy and intimate, with the artists in the middle and the audience circled around them. You're  here for the music, not the food, so I won't dwell on that. Their music overflows with passion and bleeds love. One of the songs was so real that it moved me to tears. They performed lively songs too, and had the crowd roaring with cheers. They just completely shut it down. We met the artists after the show and got pictures and autographed CDs. Carly Pearce, in particular, went above and beyond my expectations. I complimented her on one of her songs that wasn't on her EP, and she said she would email it to me. I scribbled my address on a crinkled receipt, not anticipating to ever hear from her again. Next AM, I checked my email and there it was- a sweet note from Carly and the song that touched my heart. I definitely have a newfound appreciation for country music.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They went fast! I tried to get a pair of tickets 3 times before they weren't snatched up from me by someone else. All tickets sold out by 8:03 am for the Saturday shows so you have to act fast. They require a deposit of $4 for the free shows. On the day of the show, I'll have to admit, it was kind of fun walking by the people waiting in line to get in. Be sure to get there on time or they will give away your reservation! My friend and I were at a 6-top and were seated with a lovely couple, their mother & grandmother. We got lucky to be seated with such nice people and had enjoyable conversation prior to the show starting. Once the show starts, shut yo mouf! They like to have no conversations or whispers while the artists are performing which makes sense as it's all about respecting the artists & their music.We were fortunate to have four wonderful songwriters the night we went - Jenn Bostic, Sarah Darling, Emily Shackelton and Michael Logen. They would play various tunes citing them being used by professional artists and various movies & TV shows. They are not only all great songwriters but great artists themselves. I believe all of them had CDs they were selling post show. Bluebird is a very small venue which is great because you can hear every word the artists sing and are very close to their circle in the middle of the cafe where the performing happens.The Bluebird Cafe was one of the best experiences I had throughout my whole trip and I'd do it again next time I'm in Nashville. It also turned out not to be expensive at all. They ask you to spend $7 each (random number) which is easily met by getting a couple of drinks. They had specialty pops like Diet Black Cherry - yum! I heard the food can be skipped so we ate prior to our show. Our server was so nice & beyond attentive. The show run exactly 2 hours on the dot and boy did it fly by! People then hang out to get CDs signed and have little chats with the artists. Parking can be rough but check out the secret spots in the back if they aren't any in the main lot. One of the artists I saw is now on Rising Star on ABC!The Bluebird Cafe is a must do for music fans while in Nashville!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Bluebird Cafe was by far my favorite experience in Nashville! The bartender, Martha was so friendly and knowledgeable. She recommended food and drinks and discouraged us from food that a lot of other customers had been unhappy with in the past. She was the second person to welcome us and we were lucky enough to sit at the bar. If you do not have reservations (which cost $15/person) you have to wait in line. We chose to wait in line 4 hours before the doors opened on a Saturday. We got in line at 130pm and doors didn't open until 530pm. The next people that came got to the line at 230pm so we started waiting way too long, but, we were the first people to be seated. They only have 10 seats at the bar and they have 14 pew seats. The bar is a far better area to sit than the pews. Obviously, the tables would have been better if we had gotten reservations two weeks plus prior. The setting is very intimate and we had all of the songwriters and singer sign our Bluebird Cafe merchandise. Overall, the most amazing experience!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I loved this place!Although I initially heard of Bluebird from the TV show \"Nashville\", this spot was verified as legit by some friends who are locals.  So on our recent trip to Nashville, my husband reserved us tickets to an \"in the round\" session.  Note on reservations- MAKE ONE.  They open about a week in advance of every show.  Even on a Thursday night, every seat in the house was taken.  Ticket prices were reasonable- less than $20 per person.  First thing to note is that the Bluebird is not located in downtown Nashville.  You will need to either drive or get a cab/Uber/Lyft to get here.  Also, it's in a strip mall, so there aren't many pre- or post-show dinner/drink options.  But none of that matters cause all that matters is the awesome music going on inside.Inside, I was shocked how small this place was.  But it added to the experience.  On the night we visited, the songwriters were a group of three men and one woman.  Although I had read up on them prior to arriving, I was surprised at the number of songs I knew.  The woman songwriter penned the Lee Ann Womack hit \"I hope you dance\".  It was cool to hear the people who actually write the songs performing them.Seats are cramped and you will probably sit at a table with strangers, but it didn't feel claustrophobia.  If you can, get a seat at the bar--- you can see more since you are elevated.  Drink prices seemed pretty standard for Nashville-- there is a per seat minimum (maybe 7 or 8 bucks?).  They also serve food- I would probably eat prior to the show- the food just looked like standard bar food.This is a must-visit spot in Nashville- make sure to get your reservations ahead of time- and get ready for some great music!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Bluebird Cafe is a listening room and it's well-reknowned for a venue for a songwriter's performance.  I thought it was amazing that we were able to hear the 'heroes behind the hit' perform their own songs, and song that have been recorded by chart-topping artists in all the genres of music.  It was cool as they have 2 different setups, dependent on which artists you see - they can either perform on stage or do an 'ITR' (In The Round).  We had the latter, so the songwriters actually sat in the middle of the cafe, and the tables were placed all around them.  Technically, there are no 'bad' seats, but I wished we were a little bit closer to the singers (we had Table 20) - for anyone who is claustrophobic, this can be a little challenging!  We got to see Thom Schuyler, Fred Knobloch, Jack Sundrud, and Jelly Roll Johnson (best harmonicist EVER!) - they played either as a quartet or as an individual.  The songs were just plain awesome, and the vibe was more of a laid-back atmosphere.  The guys had a great sense of humor, shared stories, and played their bits.  The only 'downside' is that you have to make reservations online (can be quite stress-ridden as I almost fainted from trying to navigate the site and it was slowed down as I'm sure hundreds of other people were trying to get a spot), and you are required to spend a minimum of $7 per seat on drinks/food - I just had a ginger ale and their housemade chips with chipotle mayo sauce - pretty safe, and it was pretty good (the chips were cold, though, but the combo was good and salty).  Our server checked up on us and was was very sweet.  You line up to your left, and the right of the entrance are for people who don't have tickets and who are offered any available seats for no-shows/cancellations.  When you walk in, you pay with cash and are seated.  I really enjoyed the experience here and I'm so glad I was able to check this place out! :D+purchase tickets online (high anxiety!)+highly suggest 'ITR' (In The Round'+$7 minimum on food/drinks\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Don Schlitz was on stage and was joined by some random \"union\" picker.  Mr. Schlitz put on a heck of a show and the picker just might have a future in Nashville. Special shout out to Joe Salvo.  He is professional, good natured and one great doorman, as well as, being the most \"photo bombed\" doorman in Nashville.  Also props to Vonda ---- quick, professional and efficient service. The baked Brie was awesome. Folks -- the \"picker\" was Vince Gill. The Blue Bird Cafe is a must see.  I can't put it any other way.  I just can't think of where else you can see such superstar talent (Mr Schlitz and Mr Gill) for only $12 in such an intimate setting.  We stayed in Nashville (on our way home to Texas) because we wanted to see the Blue Bird Cafe ----- it was sooooo worth it and I am so glad we did. Also, I am happy to know that the reservation system is improving.  The current system is a bit of a pain (back to waiting 3 hours in a stand by line), however, they are fixing it.  I can't wait to come back on my next trip to Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This sentence could also be written like this:  Who do I have to befriend to get tickets to a 9pm show at this place? Who, who, who? We've waited in line outside the doors for 3 hours to get seats to a no-reservation show; we've queued in the website ticket line for 2 hours to land a reservation for a weekend performance; and we've even rolled the dice for fate and popped in during the week when the doors opened, hoping for a miracle. It is hard to get tickets to this place. Hard, hard, hard. Yes, three (count 'em, 3!) times, we've managed to get a seat inside these hallowed strip mall walls, but once there it's a little...um...anticlimactic. With super tight seating and full-to-bursting guest count, hearing a show here is a bit like listening to a concert from your seat on a Delta flight: enjoyable, but super uncomfortable. Of course, all that said, it's still The Bluebird Cafe. And this is still Nashville, and we still love good music and good songwriters. And Deacon and Scarlett and Rayna and all our pals on ABC's Nashville still tell us The Bluebird is where it's at, so I guess we'll all have to keep sucking it up and getting up at the crack of dawn to get in the virtual ticket line or stand outside the front doors hoping the first 100 people in front of us will just go home or drop dead or something so we can get inside. Yep, we'll do it, but that doesn't mean we're going to be happy about it. Just for the record.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I might have had dessert, I don't honestly remember. I had some beers, don't remember what the beer list looked like. Really, who *actually* comes here for the drinks and food?!?3. Getting tickets/Getting In: You need to get online and get the tickets two weeks ahead of time at like 8am. I'm serious. We forgot and waited til 4pm and it was sold out. They do have a waitlist though, so call and get on it. We were told that there were often late cancels and no shows and there are pew seats that are first come first served. We were prepared to get there at like 730 for the 9:00 show, but around 2:00, they miraculously called me with two open seats at an awesome table ( I could have touched the one guy)! Once you get there, the line on the left of the door (when looking at it) is for people with tickets. The line on the right is for people without tickets. Do it right and get tickets, and you'll be happy you did.4. Music: We came on a Sunday which is Artists in the Round. It was 4 older song writers who sat around in a circle and took turns playing songs they wrote. They were AMAZING. They told stories of getting their songs \"cut\". Some of the ones that I recognized were cut a bunch of times by different artists before actually getting recorded or on an album or something. Seriously, these guys were *LEGIT*. I recognized a bunch of them, and every. single. song. was AMAZING. These weren't up and coming song writers, they knew their country music. 5. I officially love country music.

We were told that without a ticket I(which apparently sell out in less than 5 minutes after ticket sales open 1 week before every show) , we'd have to wait about 2 hours in the waitlist line only for a CHANCE to get in on the about 25 bar and pew seats. Well we were enjoying a dinner, and at first had planned on going to the listening room cafe afterwards for live music but thought we were already all the way in Nashville.. there was no harm in winging it and trying our luck in getting in for our chance to listen to live music where legendary songwriters and artists perform or are discovered.So we didn't get to the bluebird cafe until about 9pm for a 930 show and despite the warnings of FAT CHANCE, we STILL GOT IN and got great seats in the first row of the pew (which is way more comfortable than the bar seats)!!!!Finally the show... what can I say... Don Schlitz put on an incredible performance. And to be able to sing along to Randy Travis songs that I knew from childhood from the songwriter himself was priceless. He was an awesome performer-- talented, funny, charming, and a great entertainer!Got ourselves a bottle of Reisling wine and enjoyed it while listening to awesome music. Although any wine would have been just fine when we were already in musical bliss.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Pretty much hands-down my favorite place in Nashville. Period.  And I don't even like country music.  I've been able to visit three times now (two were in the round and once was in the row).  I love the \"in the round\" option and how the songwriters sit literally \"at the next table away\" from you and just have a blast sharing songs, playing off of each other, harmonizing spontaneously, and telling stories.  A lot of times they play familiar songs and it's cool to hear the story behind the songs you've heard on the radio and to get to hear them performed by the songwriter him/herself!It's very cozy inside and the food isn't spectacular...it's not terrible either.  But, you don't come here for the food anyway.  During the early shows, there's usually no cover and there's just a $7 food/drink minimum which is really nothing when you think about the amazing concert and experience you are getting while you munch on your food.Reservations open up 8 am the week before so you want to make sure that you reserve early!  Seating is very limited so you have to plan in advance!  But, it is seriously an unforgettable experience and most definitely worth it.  A Nashville must see.  I love this place and I miss it so much now!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This is truly a once in a lifetime experience and if you find yourself in Nashville, I would recommend this over any tourist attraction that you may be drawn to. It is a short drive away from the city, but totally worth it. I pre-planned this and reserved tickets online before we came, so I don't know how it works to just show up for a show. Judging by the popularity - you'd better get in line early. However, I had been on standby a week prior to the show and reserved seats the second they went on sale. Because of my willingness to do this, we got a table so close to the performers that I could have licked them. It is a small venue that holds about 100 people - very close together. However, once the show starts you will be grateful for the intimate nature of this spot. They have food, beer, wine and soft drinks only. I didn't come for the food and I only ordered a slice of homemade chocolate cake to meet the minimum $7 that they ask you to spend per person. The cake was fine, but nothing food-wise to write home about. I went to a \"in the round\" show, which is basically four singer/songwriters singing their own songs - some which have been published and some not. They tell you stories about the songs, about the business and it really is a very cool experience. Being as close as I was, it felt a little awkward to take photos, but they do allow it - just no video. The whole thing lasted about two hours and I could have sat for another two because it was just that great. I paid a measly $15 for this experience and it was by far the highlight of our trip. Don't miss this one.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Service was great and my Jack and Cokes always came just in time. We saw Becca Mancari, BrotherSister, Neal Carpenter and Jon Troast. They were all great and it was a truly magical experience to be in such an intimate setting surrounded by people who share great respect for singer songwriters. Will go back!

    "comments": "Monday Open Mic Night at the Bluebird was the highlight of my Nashville trip for sure! The deal here is you either book tickets far in advance before they've sold out or you take your chances at Open Mic Night. We did not plan ahead, but hey were there on a Monday so why not? THE WAIT - We read all the reviews that said be there an hour early and thought we'd be extra cautious, so we go there 2 hours early instead.  Tourist Fail! They hire security to ensure you aren't loitering in the parking lot early and disturbing other businesses. We were shoo' d away rather quickly. We came back exactly 56 minutes before doors open and we were already numbers 35 and 36 in line. They really mean an hour early. By 45 minutes to opening there were already 80 people in line and the venue was a capacity. Note that it's the same line for those wanting to be part of the audience and those wanting to perform, so get there early. Also, pack sunscreen, I fried in the sun waiting in the parking lot line (so worth it)! THE ATMOSPHERE - Great little venue, true listening room (so be quiet). Tables are push as close up to the front of the stage as possible. If you are lucky enough to score the front row, you feel like you are practically on stage with the artists. Great sound throughout the entire venue. Don't let the strip mall exterior fool you, this place has a great vibe. THE FOOD - Limited menu  but the prices are more than fair and the food they do provide is good. Mostly snacky items and lighter meals. We had the edamame and sweet potato fries, both were tasty. They have a full bar, including my personal favorite cider. THE SERVICE - Service was friendly and efficient. I'd totally come back! THE ENTERTAINMENT - I have to say, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Open Mic nights can be hit or miss.  There were literally artists from all over the world that had really traveled to either moved to Nashville or just came in for the week for a chance to sing at the Bluebird. Almost everyone we say had real talent. It was a great show!  I would consider this a must if you are in Nashville. Granted, it's a trek from downtown tucked away in Green Hills (suburbia). A little bit of walking and one bus ride will get you there. Or it's about a 20 minute taxi from Honkey Tonk Row.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Went on a Monday night to see a band and no reservations were allowed. Being that this was my first time EVER there, I had no idea that if you can't make reservations, you need to RUN... Stood in line 48 minutes, only to get to the front and overhear the guy saying, I just got two singles left. Well it was 6 people in line. After 48 minutes and it was cold.. So the people in front of us got pissed off by the cavalier attitude of the door dude- He was king ,and we were peasants. I mean somebody from INSIDE could have come OUTSIDE and did a quick little count and said, ALL of YALL aint getting in.. GO HOME NOW.. don't waste your time, energy and dedication because you AINT GETTING in.. NAHHH nobody warned us.. IF the people in front of us had not gotten pissed, we would have been turned away.  After we were graciously allowed to pay the fee to get in, we were led right next to the band.. I was so close I could have been IN the band. The speaker box was reach out and touch close. I can barely hear a day later. I was so close, I could have unplugged the guitar, and overtook the stage and belted out my own songs. OF course I am talentless and my feet was still frozen from standing out in the freezing elements for 48 minutes. Inside of the place is small.. I mean like itty bitty. Tables on top of tables, hardly no aisle space. Certainly a fire hazard. Service was spotty.. One minute you saw her, next minute it was time to go home. The bathroom was a mess. Mr. Door Dude  had free time after filling every lil nook and cranny with people to get a Clorox wipe and clean up in there. My wine was watered down, my cranberry and vodka was overly iced and the zips were straight out the bag, served with refrigerator cold dip.  I think the menu was limited, I ordered sweet potato fries and was told they were out. Then I was told I had until 10 to order food, and it was 9:52. IF your going cause you're a fan of the show Nashville, don't bother. IF your going because you're a fan of music.. don't bother.. it's a crappy little stage with bad sound and cramped sardine style seats. And to think they charge a fee to get in there.

What is important is that it is absolutely one of the finest music listening rooms in Nashville, which is kind of saying something. I first went when my younger brother came to visit and I was trying to find cool activities for him to experience outside of the obligatory Grand Ole Opry experience. My roommate recommended Bleubird and I am forever in his debt. You should expect to show up early and wait in line for nightly shows. It is a small venue and it is worth the wait. I ended up coming back three more times after my initial visit and would have liked to be a more frequent visitor if school obligations and financial constraints hadn't been such spoil-sports. Don't expect to come here and chat with your friends, this is a place to listen, not to speak.Pro-tip: Try and come on a singer/songwriter night and hear the stories behind the lyrics, very enjoyable!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Samantha Mathis stars in the flick too (who I fell in love with watching Pump Up the Volume) and though the movie isn't the best, the little cafe stayed with me. Fast forward to last night, when a dear friend suggested we hit up The Bluebird Cafe to catch Nashville's finest songwriters singing the hits they never recorded but painstakingly birthed. After waiting in line for about twenty minutes, they started letting us into the intimate venue. Now some may say this is a fantastic date spot, but really it'll only play that part if you're with someone you already know well as conversation is discouraged. The hushed demeanor definitely reminded me of Chicago's famed Green Mill!But that's where the parallels stop. Where Green Mill is dark, The Bluebird is sweet. While Green Mill's musicians boast with their big sound, the modest artists of The Bluebird make you wonder, 'what if?'I bet they too wonder, 'what if'.Take Gary Burr (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga…), who wowed us with just a taste of his collection of hits, performed by greats such as Kenny Rogers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Faith Hill and even Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera. Gary was as accessible as an artist can get, regaling us with his stories and forcing us to re-think music as we already knew it... a musical coup of déjà vu!Thinking about what could have been usually proves to be a bittersweet road and Gary's performance was no different. Cheers to The Bluebird for introducing audiences to the real legends behind the music and also, for reuniting songwriters with their babies. About as special as it gets.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The line started to form between 3:00 -3:30 and didn't stop even after the doors opened at 5:00. The show I was able to see was \"a row\" where the 4 artists say in a row and took turns playing and talking about their songs. It was incredible to hear these talented song writers and I felt so lucky to have been apart of the intimacy of the show. This is a must for a Nashville experience!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It is pretty impossible to get tickets here now since the show Nashville, but it is definitely worth the fight if you can.  It is even worth standing in line.  If you are going the standing in line route, be sure to get there a few hours before. The history of this place is just amazing.  It is very small and quaint inside and you watch about four or five songwriters perform songs that they have written and tell stories about them. The talent here is amazing and the drinks are good.  I am a huge fan of the Bluebird.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Some great musicians got their start in the Bluebird Cafe and I have no doubt that a ton more will play on that stage who will later play on much larger ones. It was a really fun experience with some excellent music and lots of jokes from Don Schlitz! There is a minimum food/drink order because the cover charge goes to the musicians. You don't go to eat though, especially at the late night show because the food is nothin special, so keep that in mind. It's all about the music. The beer was cheap and tastes just fine. They prefer cash! Keeps things moving quicker. Plan ahead too, apparently Friday night shows are sold out the Monday before!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The staff was friendly.  The history of the place is wonderful.  It all went by so fast.  There is a minium drink per seat but easy to meet with one drink.  The fee was $2 per seat to get tickets on their reservation system.  I also got a very cute comfortable tshirt long sleeve for $30.  I didn't know it as the time but it has \"Shhhhh\" on the back.  Make time to experience this place while in Nashville.  There is not enough parking so be prepared to walk.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Like we got there at 4:30 and were the last people to get in. I know the website says 28 seats that \"no reservations\". Can get in on, but they only let in the 1st 20-24, then you can wait for cancellations and get in at 6:15. If you don't have reservations it's all a maybe. So your best bet is to get them (good luck :)) if you don't, show up early, and hour at least.Nothing outstanding to say about the service or food/drink.  But the show was great, ours was artists in the round.We sat in the back pew, but it's so small there isn't a bad seat.Don't forget about the 7$ min, even if there is no cover.

If you're there on a sucky music night the BB is going to suck.  Fortunately, there are not too many of these, but I have experienced a couple.If you want to talk with your friends, forget about it. This is not the place to talk to your friends. This is a shut up and listen joint. This is not a bad thing, but you are locked in to doing nothing but paying attention or at least being quiet no matter how many \"ummmm... uhhhhhs\" the vocalist on stage may utter while telling the story of how the song was created. Having been subjected to a couple of very poorly prepared singer/songwriters I have experienced the desire to leap out of the window and flee.If you're looking for a meal, no... portion sizes here are apps. Food is ok, but nothing to write home about. I'm not down on the food, but I ate all their veggie options and was still hungry.I do not dislike this place, I just feel like the place is tofu, it gets whatever it gets from whoever is there. And as a venue, intimate is not the word, tight packed is the word. You need to go to the bathroom, everyone in there is probably going to notice you getting up, having a couple of people move so you can get out and walk to the bathroom.If you're looking to go out with friends and enjoy a concert, it'll work fine if you don't want to talk with them almost the entire time.Wait, if you think I'm being harsh, I'm not. If the singer I was going to see I loved, this is the place I would want to be. However what I've seen can be the most awkward displays, or the most awesome.

We went to the open mic night at 630 and were told we would not be allowed in and that there was another open mic night later that night by the staff so we came back at 815 for the \"open mic night.\" The first open mic night was free but when we showed up it turns out it was a 12$ cover charge at the door plus 7 dollar food and drink order minimum and it wasn't open mic night but rather a blues band that in my opinion was not good at all. The cafe was in terrible shape and falling apart and we were all stuffed packed into this small cafe. I wouldn't even call it a cafe. It had no theme there was no real selection for food or drinks.

Luckily, we got the last couple ones...We couldn't see very well because had some bars in front of us obstructing our view..it was really cool to listen to though.  The day we went, they had a $7 minimum food/beverage fee and no fee to get inside.  They have traditional bar food/drinks.  It was very good!  I think the whole experience was a lot of fun!  We saw a lot of people who were very good trying to make it in the music business.  We even were lucky enough at the end to see one of the writers who wrote songs for Blake Shelton and Tim McGraw.  It was such a great experience and I would love to do it again soon!I thought it was nice that the people who didn't get in were able to come inside for a couple minutes, listen to some of the music and snap a picture.  They did for that the people who couldn't get in but were in line!  It was nice of them to do!  Keep in mind, this place is really small so it doesn't fit a lot of people! My advice to you is to get there really early, way earlier than you think, but definitely squeeze this in when in Nashville!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The band that played was a blues band comprising of older guys who have clearly been playing a long time as they were fabulous.

Clearly he must hate that some people (you know, the paying and tipping customers) are fans of the show because he did not seem happy that he had to help and sell merchandise to any fan whatsoever. His attitude was a real disappointment, but I'm not letting it affect the fact that I'd travelled all the way from Australia and made a stop here purely as a fan of country music, the show, and wanted the experience.

On one of our last nights in the city we took a pricey cab out here for their open mic night. We were advised on the phone to arrive early, due to the intimate size of The Bluebird. Walking in around 6pm - we grabbed a table, just as two guitarists finished their set.The whole place was full, so we were lucky to snag some seating. A waitress quickly came by to take our order. We ordered some sweet potato fries, the blackened sandwich and the chicken sandwich. The catfish sandwich was great. Spicy and bursting with taste.The Bluebird Cafe is a big deal in Nashville. If you have the opportunity to play here - you savor it. All of the performers were so genuinely honored to be playing at such a love filled spot, in which people give their full attention to those playing. Everyone around the room appreciated the talent that glided around the room in smooth chords and octaves. While we had a great time here, I wasn't always fond of some of the more new-country ballads that were performed during the night, and preferred more of the closing soulful country stuff. I would definitely love to come here again, but would maybe try to go on a different night other than the open mic. A good time, but sometimes it's nice to know what kind of music to expect when you make a night of it.Trust.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I cannot fully explain how much I loved the Bluebird Cafe. My friends and I made reservations for a 6:30 show on a Friday night, figuring we would just get dinner there to cover the $7 minimum. The food was nothing to write home about but better than I expected (particularly the sweet potato fries and the baked brie).But the music -- THE MUSIC. Oh wow. We saw 3 guys, 1 gal, and 1 bonus accompanist who was *fantastic*. To be so close to them, to hear their passion... Well, I was so inspired I wrote a blog post about it, and my boyfriend has been playing his guitar every night since we got home. kristanhoffman.com/2011/…After that one night, we will make sure to visit the Bluebird Cafe *every* time we are in Nashville. I highly recommend it for music lovers.Tip #1: Make reservations through the Bluebird Cafe website, or else go early, because we walked in at 6:20 and almost every \"first come first serve\" seat was gone.Tip #2: The Bluebird Cafe is in a nondescript shopping center (which we were not expecting, given its reputation) with a hard to notice white sign with little blue birds and scripty writing. Parking fills up fast but there's a furniture store in the next lot over, and that's where we parked.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Unless you have a reservation (which by the way, always opens and fills up to the brim by Monday morning), good luck getting in.I think after the third time being here though. I see people making reservations and flying in here all the time, but I have simply no idea as to how to make it happen. Sad. I have finally figured out what to do if you are unable to make reservations. Get here at like 4:00 p.m. (they open at 5:30 p.m. on somedays and 5:00 on the others, check the website!). Bring your iPad/iPhone/gadget of choice with you. Park your car and wait. Once you see one or two people showing up, go line up with your friendly gadget. Either remain on the gadget until doors open or talk to to crowd of people who will pile up around you. We have had some amazing conversations here with people from all over the world (Russia, New Zealand and Nepal! YEP.). Being seated is the biggest deal here. I felt like the next morning I was so proud to throw in \"so I was at Bluebird last night..\" in every conversation. (Ok, maybe not...)$7 minimum on drinks and food. It's easy to meet. Their carrot cake is to die for. The biggest piece in the world and really, really, outrageously good. Nachos were good too. Overall, great experience. If I have the time and patience to wait, I'll come back again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The tickets go on sale one week ahead at 9AM Eastern time.  The show I attended was an \"In The Round\" session, so the 4 musicians sat in a circle in the middle of the tables and took turns playing. It was such a fun time, with excellent music!  The Bluebird has a history of launching artists' careers and lots of country music talents got their start there.  The drinks and food are nothing special, but the music and experience are unforgettable.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Needless to say, we didn't get in. Last week, my brother was visiting and I decided to make reservations. Do this. We went to the early \"Round\" show on a Saturday. Much like some reviewers have written: it was an experience truly beyond words. Powerful. My brother and I were moved and awed. The 5 musicians' that evening were musically and lyrically diverse. And, they were all fantastically gifted. The setting is intimate (our table was right next to the round) and quiet (it's all about the music here). There were only a handfull of Nashvillians in the audience, as the place has become a tourist go-to spot. No doubt, the ABC series Nashville, that regularly features the Bluebird, is partially responsible.  No matter though, the music and setting are real and authentic.  If you are looking for a night out with drinks and chatting with some music in the background, this is not the place. This is a place you come to pay attention, be grabbed, and moved by the songs.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've wanted to visit the Bluebird for about eight to ten years now, since I was in college to earn my music management degree. The Bluebird is in a nondescript strip mall next door to a dry cleaner; you could easily drive by without realizing it. It's a tiny place, but it was a great show. I know now they take reservations online; I was there the week before this was rolled out. Hopefully that will be a benefit to people. I visited with a coworker when we were in town for a conference. We stopped in on Tuesday night and got there about an hour before the early show began, so we may have gotten lucky just because of the day of the week. We didn't have reservations or anything but were able to sit in the pews, and since we were at the end of the line got a spot in the first pew.There were others there who had reservations, but I couldn't find how to do that for this show--it said that they didn't take them. Luckily, it was fine. We were there for an In The Round session, so we heard from the four artists in the round plus a bonus song from a collaborator of one of those artists. The night I was there those in the round were Vee Lasher, Madison Marie Armour, Paul Sikes, and Tony Zavitson. Vee's song plugger was in the audience too (who, judging by surname, is mother or other relative of one of the artists), so you know industry people stop in too. The show lasted an hour and a half or so, I think; long enough for each of the artists to do 4-5 songs each. It was well worth it: The music was great, the show was intimate, and everyone had a good time. I think some people might turn their nose down at the early show, thinking that it's going to be subpar; keep thinking that if you want. It'll make it easier for the rest of us to get in.I don't know about any of the tables, but the sight lines from the pews were perfect. Use the restroom before going, if you can; there are two single-use bathrooms here, one for each gender. There's a $7 minimum per person but that's an amazing deal to hear such high quality music. If you're sitting in the pews, be careful what you order since there's nowhere but your lap or hand to put your food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "If you're a music lover, then The Bluebird Cafe is akin to an abusive relationship. You'll be the one who's apologizing - for what THEY (at least in part) did wrong. So if you're the type to become any kind of loyal customer to what in theory is possibly one of the best places for live acoustic music ever, then don't go here. Or maybe I should say don't \"try\" to go here. Much like any sort of beloved significant other, it sounds pretty and doesn't look bad either. The amount of talent featured is BEYOND incredible. You get to hear much beautiful music from so many unbelievably amazing (and often VERY successful, even well-known, at that!) songwriters/singers - and in a location where you actually can HEAR it. Unfortunately, it seems and feels very deeply as if any kind of care/regard they have for customer loyalty has all but disappeared over the past several years and replaced with letting absolutely anyone, who may or may not know who it is playing that evening, in. Some random individual who just happens to wander up and so therefore can take the seat of someone who 1) knows of the artists playing and the schedule to the point that they set an alarm JUST so they'd be awake in time to make the 1-minute sellout time reservations 2) drive for approx. 2 hours just for the show, 3) tried to call multiple times so they wouldn't lose their seats but got no answer and 4) had the audacity to be 3 minutes late when the business \"policy\" is that seats *may* be given up after 15 minutes of a no-show.If you'd rather read a much shorter review than mine about a somewhat similar experience please read Kelli B's from 8/19/2013. Though she's not quite had the opportunity to be frequent, it seems the treatment is much the same.*An important aside - several times when policies are officially stated it's said the pew/bench seats are first come/first served. However, the pew/bench seats ARE among those which can be reserved with the system. Umm..?? Sure that never leads to a reserved pew seat being lost.Maybe being made even more \"world famous\" (though not really so much in their hometown) is to blame for this obscene mistreatment - but that doesn't make it a fair excuse. It is one reason why I hesitate to even write a bad word in any kind of public forum about them, however; because the likelihood of it affecting their bottom line is pretty non-existent. Nevertheless, what follows is a sampling of my very souring (to understate the situation) experience tonight. So please read below.We HAD reservations for a show, my boyfriend had even used vacation time at work for it - with such a stellar lineup (I really had been looking forward to it for weeks) we eventually decided on the Bluebird over seeing Kenny Rogers at the Ryman. Well, anyway, even after my YEARS of loyalty (and more recently also putting up with new employees who had never seen me telling me rules I've known for years) when we got there at approximately 9:03 after the drive from Murfreesboro we were told \"our\" seats had been given up to someone without reservations. I know the Bluebird's supposed 15 minute policy but it hadn't even been 5. AND I had TRIED to call several times with NO answer, to say we were on the way. I miss the days when they would care enough to call the customer themselves just to check. So even with customer loyalty, so-called \"reservations,\" a $4 nonrefundable reservation fee  - which is normally OK if losing the seats is actually at all my own doing - and the drive to and from Nashville I guess just a little bit of wanting to stay in and having a hard time leaving my loving cat has cost all this grief. Obviously, with all the tourists, especially now because of \"Nashville,\" loyal customers who actually go there for the music mean nothing. Yet another situation that pushes me to just entirely give up on caring about music. All that said, I'm sure it's still a perfectly fine place as long as you don't plan to frequent it. Or have to drive any substantial amount of distance to do so. And don't have reservations. Or if you do, aren't a few seconds late. Oh, and hey, if you do get a table (probably one allegedly saved for someone else) or even a bar seat, don't forget there's a $7 food/drink minimum. Have fun and enjoy the music for me.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Neither my husband or I had ever been to the Bluebird Cafe up until a few weeks ago. And we've both been here 10+ years! Ridiculous and unacceptable, I know! Well, the perfect opportunity presented itself a short while back in the form of two of our friends from college performing in a round one Tuesday evening! The round consisted of Michael Logen, Eric Vinson, Jillian Edwards and Stacy Lantz. We were there to support Michael and Eric and were pleased with our experience of both the musical talent presented and the atmosphere and food offerings of the Bluebird Cafe.I love little intimate venues. The sound quality seems better overall and it's just more of an inviting experience. We had made our $2 reservations a week ahead of time and we made sure to meet our $7 food \"cover\" minimum by ordering the chicken tenders and sweet potato fries. YUMMO! Our waitress was quick, attentive and friendly. She was a pro at meandering her way through the cramped quarters of the venue. I would have knocked at least 10 people over.We really enjoyed our experience and hope to go back again soon!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We ended up doing a walk-up for the 6pm show on a Thursday night and got to the Bluebird around 5:10pm. The line didn't seem that long, but apparently they had already let people who had been waiting earlier get in. After waiting for almost an hour, we were THE last three people to make it in (whew!) Note: Get tickets online or get there at least an hour early to wait in the line at the right (facing the door) which is the one for people without reservations. The one on the left is for people with tickets so you wouldn't want to get stuck waiting in that line only to find out it was the wrong one!Since it was already jam packed, we ended up having to split up and our friend had to sit at a table close to the stage and my husband and I ended up sitting in one of the pew seating towards the back. The good thing was, there is no cover for the earlier show like there it for the late show, we just had to order drinks or food (same as the late show too).The show we watched was \"in the row\" where the musicians were sitting at the \"stage area\" in a row. The music, banter and stories were AMAZING and it was truly a joy to watch these songwriters share their talent. There were even a couple of songs that I recognized that night! I would definitely bring friends who are visiting Nashville here and will be going back often!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was even better than my previous visits! We waited in line for about 20 minutes as we did not have a reservation. Imagine our surprise when we were escorted by the friendly hostess to the BEST seat in the house...a table for 2 directly in front of the stage!

The night we came, we had the chance to listen to four amazing singers In The Round: Will Rambeaux, Sherrie Austin, Shane Hines and Liz Sharpe. The round format means the musicians play in the middle and the entire crowd surrounds them. The four were free to play acoustically or with full electric boostage, and both styles sounded great.I loved how casual the four were despite the fact that Will and Sherrie are incredibly well known and have written for a number of the biggest singers out there. The service was so-so, and my Dad and sister's seats in the far back were a bit awkward, but I think the music more than made up for it!Quick tip: plan to buy your tickets a week in advance.

    "comments": "I was booked here for a writer's night over 3 months ago, and when I arrived, I was told I was not on the list. Not only that, but my violinist had already made the trip from Memphis. Great.I had played at the Bluebird 3 times beforehand, so I was prepared to deal with some snotty folks, but this night topped it all. My boyfriend was literally pushed out the door by the host after he was told he would have to wait for over an hour to enter the Bluebird and would have the \"privilege\" of paying a fee to sit at a table (none of which would be going to the writers in our round, of course). The Bluebird may be historical, but that gives the staff no right to be snotty, pretentious, and BEYOND rude. I have played at many \"historical\" venues, including where Elvis played his first show & where Johnny Cash played his first show and have never dealt with people that were THIS full of themselves. Supposedly the Bluebird was not like this back in the 80's. Does the fact that Taylor Swift was \"discovered\" at Bluebird really give them the right to be snotty? You tell me.Also, the food service is terrible. At just about any place you go, people try to keep the beers coming. Not at The Bluebird. When my family came to see me play last time, my dad had the privilege of nursing one of their lukewarm beers for over 3 hours. Super.The sound is mediocre, to say the best, and is certainly not the best live sound in Nashville. However, the sound engineer and bartender were the only hospitable people that entire night. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in the door and the girl in charge of seating people greeted me with a smile. I asked her where there was a free table and she told me that she didn't work there. Figures. The actual host came and was promptly as rude as I remember always being treated at The Bluebird.  Since this was the FOURTH time my entire party of folks and I have been treated badly by the Bluebird, we left. I called the manager at Taps and Tapas, and he fit us in for a last minute show that night.I will never be playing the Bluebird again. Go to Belcourt Taps and Tapas if you wanted to be treated like a human being. If you'd rather be treated like an unworthy imbecile, go to The Bluebird.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Ahhh, what more can we say about the Bluebird? It's famous, legendary, the stuff dreams are made of! There's even a movie inspired by it. I played the open mic on Spring Break in my senior year of college and felt like I had totally made it. The school paper even wrote about my \"tour\" when I got back, but the they said we played at the BlueBERRY Cafe. So maybe it's not that famous. For a traveling songwriter and music fan, the Bluebird is a heavenly oasis of attentive crowds and crystal clear sound in a desert of noisy bar gigs. The focus here is 100% on the songs. Fancy decor, gourmet food and creative drinks would really just distract form the music, so don't look for that. And don't let your voice rise above a whisper, or you'll be shushhhed. Some people find this really oppressive, but for 2 hours or so, you can handle it. When the show is over, you can go back to your regular rowdy self at another bar. Let yourself just be still and enjoy the best songwriters in Nashville singing a few feet away from you. That's a rare find.Make reservations if you can plan in advance and avoid tables 2 and 22 when you are going to an \"In The Round Show\" or you'll have a somewhat obstructed view. Even if you have reservations you'll probably be sharing a table with strangers, make sure to get there early to snag the seats with a better angle. The website has lots of info, so if you are going for the first time, check it out first to get some history and figure out how the place works. Have fun and buy a CD from the songwriters!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "(From an article I wrote for Examiner.com, I own the rights: examiner.com/x-2219-Loui…) During my weekend in Nashville, no place exhibited more soul and character than the Bluebird Cafe, an intimate music club in a strip mall five miles from downtown.Early shows at the Bluebird usually feature up-and-coming songwriters. But as the first performer I noticed resembled Rip Van Winkle, it was clear early on that the 6:30 p.m. show on Feb. 28 would be different.Rather than hearing young singer/songwriters demo new material, four accomplished country troubadors---Don Wayne, Bill Carlisle Jr., Glen Douglas Tubb (Van Winkle's doppelgänger) and Jimmy Payne---shared songs they wrote for the likes of Johnny Cash, George Jones and Tammy Wynette.The In The Round performance resembled VH1's Storytellers, only times four. The men went around the circle intermixing their songs with banter about how they were created and the business of songwriting (apparently $0.14 royalty checks are not unheard of).When one man was performing, the others would somtimes fill in on background music, lightly pluck their guitars or even hum a steel guitar solo.With just 21 tables, 25 spots at the bar and some benches, the atmosphere at Bluebird Cafe was like music being played around a campfire rather than a formal performance. I felt like a voyeur, getting an inside glimpse at Nashville's supportive artist's community.Experiencing a transformation while traveling might be cliché, but, well, clichés exist for a reason. Before going to the Bluebird Cafe, I was more likely to make a joke about country music than I was to listen to a song of that genre. But two hours listening to these four singer/soungwriters gave me an appreciation for the style and the realization that country music transcends pickup trucks, dying dogs and cheating spouses.The humor of some of the songs (such as Wayne's \"Belles of Southern Bell\" and Carlisle's song about junk mail) is all too absent in the rock music that I usually listen to. When I got home, I purchased many of their songs via iTunes.The menu mentioned Bluebird Cafe's originally intention to be a gourmet cafe, but its standard bar fare made clear that those aspirations were junked. Regardless, the musical performance was so strong, the restaurant can get away with medicore food. There is a $7 per person food and drink minimum though.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The hostess smiled and greeted everyone all night with a positive attitude despite telling individuals they had to wait outside or turning others away on the phone. 15min after the show started, she was quick and got all the empty table seats filled within 5min.

Singing songs written straight from the heart - religious, sad, life lessons, etc. I would've sat there all night if possible.Food -had the chicken quesadilla.

When we questioned why our food had not come out after 25 min, we were rudely told \"It's coming.

No previous yelper really let us know what to expect besides \"you will wait in line\". We decided to go on a Sunday night where no reservation is required. For the 8pm show we got there at 630pm. The line was already at least 80 people deep. Every one waiting seemed to be from out of town, no locals, so the conversations I got to listen to for an hour and a half were a little annoying. We almost made it in, only about 8 people left in front of us but no luck. As for parking forget about the front parking lot if there is already a show going on. We parked directly behind the bluebird cafe, possibly an employee lot. No signs saying not to and a lot of open spaces. So get there about 2 hours a head of time.

    "comments": "I learned about The Bluebird through the movie 'The Thing Called Love' (starring River Phoenix, Samantha Mathis, Sandra Bullock and Dermot Mulroney in the 90s) which did a lot of filming inside The Bluebird. So, when I took a trip to Nashville, it was a must-visit.We called well in advance and got reservations for an in-the-round night. We had dinner, though the food wasn't memorable, and the drinks were a bit over-priced. But the music is what makes this place what it is. As other reviews have stated, the age of the songwriter is gone. But it's still great to hear good, live music. And during the in-the-round, the musicians were RIGHT THERE, touchable, not on a stage.I had a great time, and will go again if ever back in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Just know going into it that it is a place where music is respect. That means cell phones off and not really a place to table conversations. Don't be surprised by the $7 minimum per person. I've seen plenty of people be surprised when they get their bill at the end of the evening and end up paying just to cover the minimum when they could have got something for that money. The easiest way to use the minimum is to eat dinner there. The food is alright, nothing spectacular. I'm sure a couple of drinks would use up the minimum as well.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It would be nice if they just sold tickets so people didn't have to wait for hours.We arrived around 4pm for a 7:30 show (doors at 6:30) and the line was already about 10-15 deep. The walkway where you wait isn't entirely shaded, so it can be quite hot and sweaty. All that being said, once you're in, the Bluebird is charming and has a great ambience.

I knew nothing about Nashville, where to go, where to eat, where to hear some good music. Fortunately one of the people that I was with had family in Nashville and told us to go to The Bluebird Cafe because a friend was playing that evening. After a long day at a trade show, busting out of the hotel for some music sounded great. No one knew what to expect. When we pulled up, the cafe was packed. It was standing room only for a while but we eventually found some seats. The Bluebird Cafe is tiny, but they cram people in there, and for good reason. Monday night was singer/songwriter night. Those trying to make their mark and those that just wanted to sing their song were singing that night...from 13 years old to 85 years old everyone was very talented. We don't have anything like this in Dallas. Once the singer/songwriter show was over the Mike Henderson Band came on and they were the best blues band I have seen...that was my church for the week.Our server was great always making sure we had everything we needed. The food was nothing special but I don't see The Bluebird Cafe as a place to go for dinner, more of a place to see some good music and just get a bite. I'd recommend The Bluebird Cafe to anyone, I just wish we had something like this in Dallas.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Bluebird. The famed Blue Bird. I don't think most people realize that when someone- a Taylor or Faith, for example, is \"discovered\" there, they didn't just have a show there. They were already signed to a manager (Britney Spears' manager, in Taylor's case, before she even moved to Nashville) or a publisher, who then arranged for several record labels to attend their showcase at the Bluebird. That's fine. That's how it's done. Frankly- randomly, suddenly getting a record deal from an open-mic nite at the Bluebird, or any other venue- is as likely as getting free sex from a stripper. And I'm quoting a record-label president. Who shall remain nameless. Anyway. The famed blue bird of fame. If you want free... \"entertainment,\" equal parts hopeful, wistful, and tragi-comic, go to that open-mic night on Monday. It's a requirement for anyone who wants to play there eventually, and it's really weird and sad. The very, very good, next to the not-so-good, and the very bad. A better bet are the Writer's nights other nights of the week, featuring professional songwriters that have been vetted by the staff. These are songwriters who have hits and publishing deals. They tell the stories behind the hits, and it's really fascinating.You will find attending these evenings at the Bluebird to be much more fun. These people are excellent performers and writers. They have slugged it out to be on top of Nashville's heap. It's pretty cool. Watching them play can even change your life. It's inspiring. Most of them have worked as waiters and parking valets, doing all sorts of things before finding success. Yes, there will be a cover. There will be a drink minimum. Be sure to check it all out on their website before you go. No, you cannot be loud or make noise. It's a performance venue dedicated solely, and quite intensely, to performance. That's the Bluebird makes their living, is by being a dead quiet performance space people can count on. I like that a LOT better than the Basement, where I went to go hear Jessi Colter (\"I'm Not Lisa,\" The Outlaws) play- an experience unlikely to happen again soon, if ever again in my lifetime. She is iconic. I have waited since childhood to see her sing. A drunk woman screamed along loudly off-key for her entire set. I wanted to cry. My whole family knew I was going and wanted to hear about her set. Did the staff stop her? No. Jessi good-naturedly made comments about it. It was so bad.A teenage girl and her mom were CRYING in the bathroom. They had driven all the way from Texas to hear Jessi! This is why it is awesome that the Bluebird shushes people for talking. Some of us really do care about the music, and some people really do need to be taken out of music venues because they can't control themselves or their noise level.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I realized there was no way I could avoid Country Music but I never expected to like it. I was mistaken! My friends took a bunch of to the Blue Bird and I had a fantastic time.I wouldn't say that the menu and/or anyone's food was that spectacular. There's your standard bar fair food that includes Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Fingers, Fries, Chips and Salsa, etc. The beer list was pretty limited too but no one's really there for that, it's the music that draws the crowd. There were four different musicians sitting in a circle. They each took a turn playing one song or reading. It felt more like I was a fly on the wall in recording studio, or watching musicians truly appreciate one another. I have never seen people listen with such intensity and appreciation. If you're in the Nashville area, the Blue Bird is definitely a place you have to stop, and listen. You'll get lost in Country Music, if only for one night.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The people nice and enthusiastic. The house gets packed so go early to get in the door.

    "comments": "Even though it is a bit pointless to review the bluebird i will give my opinion anyway. The bluebird is what it is. A highly touted, famous, live music venue. While this makes me proud being a Nashville, green hills native, i do believe it is over hyped and over rated. At the bluebird fun is out. You will sit in these wooden chairs, no talking, you must buy at least two overpriced drinks and i would eat before you go. The thing is Nashville is loaded with live music venues, most of them showcasing artist who probably wrote the songs that made the bluebird artist famous. If you are visiting Nashville for sure visit the bluebird if you can, but dont believe for a second that this is the best and only place to hear live music ,and most are free.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Lucky for us Sunday night is singer/songwriter night and they don't take reservations. Notch one up for first come, first serve baby! The interior is old, eclectic and quaint. They had the dining area facing a small intimate stage where some amazing performers sang for us throughout the evening.  I loved that it was a no talking, no cell phone, and no craziness night where the focus was on the music and the food. I ordered a quesadilla and it didn't set the world on fire although it was good. The sweet potato fries are awesome and the chicken sandwich my friends ordered was \"great\" in their words. No, I didn't eat their sandwich you sicko. We're fiends, but like I said we work together, so eating a coworkers dinner would not be cool. The beer and wine list looked good, and the service was spot on considering the amount of people crammed into this little restaurant. These guys would be at a 5 star rating if the food were a little better, but overall I like the place and I'd recommend Sunday nights to anyone looking for good food, great music and a great atmosphere.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

At the Blue Bird you get the true up and comers in the field. Song writers and performers alike share the stage for an evening of music in the round.

Young singer/songwriters pin their hopes and dreams on getting a chance to sing back up at the Bluebird, or perform at Open Mic Night, and maybe, just maybe, lightening will strike. Everyone who performs here is talented and good. It just depends on the type of music you like. Famous acts like Christopher Cross have graced the stage, so don't think it's only country. But, naturally, that genre is the main one you'll hear. See Flora H's review on \"In The Round.\" This is the most popular event at the Bluebird. And I love hearing the songwriter sing his/her own songs. It's so cool to compare them to what we've all heard on the radio by the Big Name's!I also agree with Robin S., the place is very small. But, I enjoy the intimate setting. And to know that so very many famous singers got their start here, there is a reverent feeling to the place. No joke.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Not only was the staff, some of which were new hires, amazingly friendly and prompt, but the level of entertainment was unlike I've seen in a while. Although you're required to wait in a line that trails alongside the narrow sidewalk of the building, the wait is usually short and the people in line always eager to make friends.

It is certainly a piece of Nashville history and although I had a negative experience there I would encourage others to attempt it themselves. I went on a Monday night and arrived early. There were no available seats and we were crowded into a short hallway where I expected we were waiting to be seated at some point. Someone who worked at the bluebird was very upset that I was holding the outside door open. It couldn't close because there were too many people waiting and musicians were desperately trying to squeeze in and out. This woman actually pushed me quite hard forcing me into the hallway where several people almost fell over. Not cool!!!! There was also a woman droning on and on and on about all the rules regarding the open mic night. She went on for about 20 minutes but no one came to address the line blocking the door. There was no hostess and not enough chairs. When the music actually started it was so horrible that the decision was instantly made for us and we left! The bluebird does need to take responsibility for its environment and I for one will probably not come back. Especially after being pushed by one of the employees!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I love this place. I came here for the Nashville restaurant week, which Fifty First was offering a three-course meal for $35. It sure was worth it! First course: -my date and I both ordered the carpaccio (it was melt-in-your mouth delicious-easily my favorite thing!)Second course: -I ordered a pan seared fish with vegetables and a lemon puree (exotic, good flavors, fish cooked really well)-Date ordered the steak and sausage (I tried a piece of his steak, which I can vouch for was very good and he liked his dish as well) Third course: -I ordered the abuelita chocolate pie with the cayenne and chocolate ice cream (obsessed with the chocolate pie the ice cream was a bit much, too spicy!)-He ordered the ricotta wanna cotta with rum cherries, coffee crumble & vanilla bean ice cream (he ate it all and said it was delicious)I ordered chardonnay which was tasty and he got a beer. Both were good!As for the ambiance it is in a residential neighborhood and is like a house that was converted into a restaurant. When you walk into the middle of the restaurant there is a fireplace in the middle of the room with two entryways beside it which makes it seem that maybe they knocked down a wall to make it into one room. It has a very cool, comfortable feel to it. The patio wraps around the restaurant had a large number of guests outside (i guess when its 70 degrees in Nashville in the middle of January you go for it) and makes for a relaxed and cozy place. Would highly recommend this place and I'll be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We came here for my husband's birthday, and I was not exactly sure what to expect. Because I just went on a trip to Italy and Spain a couple months ago, my standards for Italian and tapas places are insanely high these days. Fifty First Kitchen did not disappoint. My husband started with a delicious cocktail called \"Fall for All\" that made me want to come back and try one of every drink on the menu. It was a perfectly crafted cocktail. I would go back just to sit at the bar and have a drink sometime.Our server highly recommended the chicken liver mousse for the first course, so we gave it a shot! I must admit I would not have been brave enough to try this on my own, but it was very good! We also had a salad that was great.Next, we had the gnocchi with oxtail and crab spaghetti. Both were amazing, but the gnocchi was my favorite dish of the night! We had the steak as an entree. Contrary to some other reviews of the place, I was very pleased with the portion size. It is a tapas place, so just make sure you order a few things! Because we had 4 small plates first (2 of them pasta), an entree was easily shared between the two of us. I would recommend going with like 2-6 people. I could see it being difficult with more than that.I was stuffed after the steak, but I always make room for dessert! And I am so glad I did because the dessert I had here was one of the most interesting and delicious combinations I have ever had. It was some sort of chocolate orange tart with a marshmallow topping. But the best part was the sweet potato ice cream that came with it. SO good and different! With such friendly service and delicious food, I will definitely be back! In warmer weather, they have an adorable patio that I can't wait to try.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I always root for the locals to a fault, however this place delivered as I had hoped. Great location and Damion our server was attentive and confident in what we should be having from drinks, apps, and entrees. Damion was very knowledgeable and ensured we had a great time. I give 4.5 stars only because the apps were just a little underwhelming. The owner and or manger found out it was birthday. She came to the table and offered me the pick of several envelopes? I picked and was presented with a sighed card wishing me a happy birthday by the entire staff! Great touch and completely unexpected as it also included a 15 dollar gift card. We will be back and thank you to the entire team for making me feel special on a special day with my best friends!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So when we arrived (after 5:30) we were strangely pressured by the Hostess to sit at the bar to enjoy Happy Hour.  We tried to indicate that we wanted a table for dinner. She kept directing us to the Bar. After what seemed like an entire comedy sketch she finally revealed that Dinner seating didn't start 5:30PM. We both produced our phones and pointed at the the screen indicating the hour (which was 5:40). We were promptly seated.As far as the menu goes, this place is not cheap. Yelp appropriately indicates this, but I guess we had failed to do our research so we were a bit caught off guard.  Additionally, although the menu SEEMS to be divided into appetizers and main courses at least half of the items on the main course part of the menu seemed to be \"Bigger Appetizers\".  You can tell where the real food starts as soon as the price doubles.For my entree I had the Duck Meatballs, which were spectacular. I wish the portion had been a bit larger, but this is one of the \"Big Appetizers\". There was absolutely nothing whatever to complain about taste wise, but I still wish it was enough for a whole meal. It isn't.For Dessert we had the Goat Cheese Cheesecake with Coffee Ice Cream which was so fantastic that I recommend it to anyone who stops in here. If anything this will be the item that gets us to come back.Overall it's recommended, but it isn't for casual dining. It's a great place to bring a date, or stop in for happy hour for some cocktails at the bar.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

First off, my server was amazing!! She literally explained every single item on the menu when she introduced herself to me - some may find this excessive, but I enjoy learning about the menu layout and the food before I make a decision on my meal. I ordered several items so that I could try as much as possible while dining solo.I started with two charcuterie options: beef salami cotto and juniper smoked salmon. I definitely preferred the salmon and wish the portion was larger. The beef itself was great, but I was not a fan of the beets. Their homemade lavash is tasty and super crunchy. The pasta that I ordered tasted so fresh! It was paired with lemon and pecorino.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The restaurant and portions are just too small and it's not a cheap meal.The restaurant is located in a home that was remodeled to be a restaurant and is very nicely decorated and homey feeling. If I lived in the Nations, I could see myself here often to enjoy a cocktail and some food! We ordered a few appetizers to share, the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad, and cheese/meat plate to name a few. All of it was good, but I especially liked the cheese and meat plate. For entrees we all had a few bites of everything, the whole red snapper fish was fantastic and the pastas were good. Once again, all of the items were good but small portions that are not ideal for sharing. I had around 6 bites and definitely needed dessert. I had the blackberry float with goat cheese ice cream, and it was very good! I was glad I ordered it to help quell my still semi-hungry stomach. Bottom line: I paid $70.00 and was still pretty hungry when I left. I want to return again and go with my SO and see how the experience differs.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Quote of the night: \"Is it gluttonous if we order one of everything on the menu?\"  \"Absolutely not.\"According to the website, Fifty First is a \"seasonally focused neighborhood restaurant with technique rooted in rustic Italian cuisine.\"  There's ample parking, though I will warn against wearing heels as the lots are gravel/uneven.  There's a large porch, and the inside feels very much like a dark, hip bar set in an old house.  It's intimate and comfortable at the same time, so you'll see people wearing anything from street clothes/jeans to dressy attire.  Very Nashville, I'd say!The menu at Fifty First is printed daily, though I noticed a lot of the items reflect the ones on their website; that said, it wasn't identical, so I applaud the chef for basing the day's menu on what is in season and what's inspired for the day.  We started with charcuterie, selecting the chicken liver pate (served with warm rye bread and an apple-vanilla delicious jam), galantina (spricy pork shoulder), coppa (dry cured pork shoulder), salami finocchiona (dry cured salami with fennel), with the meats served with some green beans and accoutrements.  For cheese, we had the cave aged gouda (raw cow) and mona extra-aged (sheep and cow), served with flatbread and honey.The charcuterie was amazing.  We had to try every combo... bread + cheese and bread + pate and bread + jam and cheese + jam and cheese + honey and on and on...  YUM.  We had to ask for more rye bread, as there wasn't enough for the pate, and PATE WAS THE BEST.  All caps.  Seriously, we were bowing down to the excellent pate in its superior flavor and smooth texture.  It was amazing.  I want to feed it to my future babies.We consulted our server before making our next move.  We'd initially decided to order one of everything on the menu, but then the charcuterie menu came and we knew we had to make some cuts.  With her help, we cut the number in half and ordered six of the day's twelve menu items.To assist with our feast, the server/kitchen staff paced us with a few courses at a time.  We started with the buckwheat sourdough focaccia, served with olio verde and marigold ricotta.  I'm a big bread fan, so I LOVED the pure simplicity of this.  I would eat it every day if I could.After the focaccia, the grilled octopus arrived, served with romano beans, arugula, and preserved lemon.  We also had the tomato panzanella, with goat feta, watermelon, and moscatel vinaigrette.  Everything was tasty.  Octopus was something new for me, and the taste was mild but good.  The way it was plated, I don't think most people would have realized what it was.  The panzanella was yummy too.But honestly, these were not the rock stars of the evening, because of what came next...One of my favorite dishes of the night was the radiatore nero, with rock shrimp, chiles, guanciale, and charred tomato.  The pasta was soooo fresh, and a beautiful black color from the squid ink.  The shrimp were delicious and cute (can I say that and keep my wannabe foodie card?) and the spicy kick to the sauce was on point.  This arrived with the octopus and panzanella, and I honestly couldn't focus on the others because I was obsessed with the radiatore.  Good pick, dear server.  We salute you!And then there was MEAT.  We ordered the lamb & pork sausage served with field peas, roasted peppers, and vin cotto.  We also had the grilled PRB steak, served with AMAZING lamb fat potatoes, lobster mushrooms, and balsamic.Um, delicious.  I think the sausage was a clear favorite for the table.  We actually had to wait a little for these courses, because our ticket was misplaced in the kitchen; our server topped off our wine gratis, and the chef brought the food out with apologies.  But the thing is, we didn't even notice the delay!  We were so blissfully enjoying a break in our gluttony, knowing we had more ahead...  but I'll take any excuse to pay our compliments to the chef, because he was really fantastic!  (You're awesome, Tony Galzin. Bravo.)  In fact, our service was pretty amazing the entire time.  We never wanted for anything, the servers cleared the many courses quickly and even brought us lots of fresh silverware throughout the evening, all swiftly and adeptly and without complaint or looks of \"are these people still eating... MORE?!\"For dessert, we had peach semifreddo with pecan crumble and white peach-thyme compote.  So this dessert didn't knock my socks off like a few of the other dishes, but it was still tasty.  Peaches are about gone for the year so I had to take advantage; the peach and pecan combo was soooo yummy.  I think I would have eaten a bowl of the crumble and compote and then skip the semifreddo itself.  But it was good... I mean, we ate the whole thing if that tells you anything.The moral of this story?  Eat at Fifty First Kitchen & Bar, before it's impossible to get a reservation.  You don't have to share dishes like we did, as the portions are ample.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was presented with a lovely chef's tasting. I was invited in compliments of the chef and manager after a shaky pop up experience. I only mention this as a back story to the dichotomy of how organized and flavorful this new experience was. I was impressed. All courses were beautifully seasoned and wonderfully presented. Standouts for me were the tortelli and sausage. Whatever nutty seasoning was in the tomato salad was fantastic. The desserts were wonderful and had a great balance - not too sweet. Furthermore, I appreciate that the chef and owners cared enough to invite us in to try the menu in a kitchen environment he had more control in. The menu is a bit before its time in sophistication for the neighborhood but will likely catch up as the city grows. It's much more of something you would expect in Germantown or Lincoln Park Chicago. (Which isn't a bad thing if you've eaten in either neighborhood)Additionally, after Instagram stalking food photos from the chef and other diners; I'm pretty interested in trying the whole fish (red snapper looks to die for) and the pork belly if it returns to the menu (didn't see it on tonight's full menu). The cheese and dried meats looked pretty dope as we peaked at what was coming out to other tables.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Also had an incredible salad with local lettuce and apples, and post Thanksgiving welcomed a smaller plate, and opted for the cavatelli with rabbit sausage, wife with mushroom risotto.

    "comments": "A micro \"restaurant\" that does not serve actual meals.Ordered heirloom tomato salad and cavatelli pasta w/heirloom tomato, white anchovy, capers, basil. The waitress stated as we ordered the portions were small, almost apologizing/warning us in advance that we were to receive small portions. But what arrived was laughable. One tomato (that was small) constituted the salad--albeit a nice yellow heirloom tomato with a few lettuce sprigs. Then the pasta, on the menu as an entree. Maybe 18 pieces of pasta dusted with herbs. The dish was  less than 1/4 cup. Not kidding.  When the plate arrived it looked absurdly empty. The quality off the food was very good. But $15 for a pasta \"dinner\" entree that  was RIDICULOUSLY tiny is beyond the pale. My wife also received a micro portion of risotto and an undersized lettuce salad with hard (thin.micro) peach slices  (and explained and complained after the \"meal\" to the very kind waitress).  I applaud restaurants that serve dishes of great quality as opposed to gargantuan portions but spending over $100 for dinner/drinks and then having to go home and make an omelet (which I did) was a first. There are generous portions, large portions, recommended size portions and joke portions. Sad to say this menu is a joke at least as to these pasta and salad portions. The staff was as friendly as can be and the atmosphere was very nice. But as a restaurant Fifty First \"Kitchen\" & Bar  is a kitchen failure unless MEALS are actually served. As the owner is planning to open  another \"restaurant\" nearby (\"Nations\") I will await update to reviews to see if meals are being served.  I note that \"tiny portions\" are critiqued in other reviews (e.g. \"Cold Happy Tourist's\"  review on Open Table May 4, 2016). Change the name to Tapas Bar in the meantime.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We left hungry after spending over $300. The cocktails were good. The thing that was so odd is when we called, around 5:30,to get a table and they said we couldn't get a reservation until 8:30 unless we came right away. No problem, we were renting a house right across the street. However, there was no one there when we got there and two other couples there when we finished. We drove by around 8 and still looked pretty empty. Potential but I will not return.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We sat on the patio which perhaps was the most pleasant part of the experience. Each of us ordered a cocktail which proved overly strong or in the case of the bourbon concotion - overly bitter. For a light bite we had the meatballs which proved rich and well spiced however the sauce they floated in was bland and oily. We also ordered the goat cheese stuffed shisito peppers which were all around terrible- overly cooked and burnt tasting instead of charred. It was a cool neighborhood atmosphere just not great food and drinks.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Depending on the day of the week you can find a big name artists, a nobody songwriter or a No. 1 hit songwriter. It's an extremely small venue and if you want a seat you better come early. They have songwriter rounds, benefit shows, showcases, the works - it just depends on the night. I will never forget the songwriter I saw the first time I was there, Sean Patrick McGraw, he is still a nobody but I listen to the CD of his I bought that night all the time. You might think you've missed it when you come, because it sits in a shopping mall, but you'll love it. They usually have a drink/order minimum too. They serve food, but remember it's bar food and not that great. I usually snack, rather than make it a meal.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I have never seen a bad show here, have never had a bad experience.  I am \"in the know\" though and feel lucky that a friend gave me the rundown before I went for the first time.  You definitely need it!1) RESERVATIONS!!!  These can be kind of tricky because they start taking reservations for weekend shows (Friday and Saturday shows only) on the Monday before.  And you have to call between like 10am and 4pm I think.  If you get a busy signal, just keep calling.  I prefer the late show on Friday night--9pm I think?  No particular reason though.  2) There is a strict \"no talking\" (while the musicians are playing) rule which is cool, but you HAVE to know this before you go!  For example, don't go if you are meeting your long-lost friend that you have 5 years of catching up to do.  Or don't bring a bunch of chatty women.  And don't bring kids!  Also, it's a good date place, but if you are trying to get to know someone, this isn't where you should go.3) The food isn't great.  If you go for an early show, you can definitely eat, but they aren't known for their cuisine.  Think chicken fingers and fries, club sandwiches, and burgers.  Definite bar food.  If you go for a late show, you can go to dinner nearby before, but plan on getting there at least 20 minutes early even if you have reservations.  4) It's a REALLY small place.  Prepare to be packed in like sardines, and if you have a small party, you might be sitting with people you don't know.  Deal with it!  You can't talk to them anyway!  You will see exceptional songwriters and singers--you may never have heard their names, but more than likely you will have heard of at least one song they wrote.  It's the coolest thing, and by far one of my favorite places in Nashville.  Possibly THE best to hear live music in an \"intimate\" setting!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Ok. Kudos to the owner who just sold the place who has shepherded the careers of so many musicians and has made this hangout a haven for singer-songwriters in Green Hills. It's nice she didn't sell out when I'm sure she could have made a fortune off of the place. It is tiny, but it is Green Hills.1. Yep, they do take reservations. If you don't have reservations, prepare to stand in line. It was a freezing cold February when a friend and I stood in line. Thankfully, most people in the line were polite, and our group did make it inside.2. There's a cover. I don't mind paying a reasonable cover. I think this show was $10. Ok, not terrible, but, then there's a minimum food and drink charge once you get in. Hello? I just paid you at the door. That's going to the musicians? Ok, I'll get a drink, but I don't appreciate being forced to have a drink.3. It's tiny. You are going to be crammed in a table and will not feel like trying to get up to go to the bathroom or anything else. 4. Service is kind of slow. Again, tiny space so it's hard to move around, and many customers...not exactly a good formula for excellent service.5. The whole \"shhh\" thing. Ok, the musicians are playing (and you are probably within reach of them). People are there to see them play. I get it, fine. But, isn't it kind of weird that it is a bar and (nominal) restaurant and you can't talk? I'd understand if the Ryman had a \"shhh\" policy, but a bar?Ok, so that's my take on it. Obviously this place has quite the reputation. I just think they've made it harder than it needs to be to enjoy it. The music is going to be good, so why have all these rules and rigamarole to get through?\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Being from Austin, I am very familiar with our live music/singer-songwriter scene, and wanted to check out what Nashville had to offer.  I was not disappointed!  We caught the \"In the Round\" set, where instead of utilizing the stage, 4 musicians set up in a circle in the middle and each take turns playing their songs (many of which had been cut by big country stars).  It was intimate and amazing!  We noshed on some fried green tomatoes, sweet potato fries and a couple local brews.  Food wasn't spectacular, but not bad for bar food, and who would come here for the food anyway?  We enjoyed it so much that we decided to go back on our last night.  This time a band was scheduled and they were impressive as well.  Unfortunately, we were exhausted and had an early flight, so we had to leave before it was over.  Even if you are not a country music fan, I would highly recommend checking out The Bluebird.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Bluebird Cafe has always been at the top of my list when I visit Nashville.  If you go for an early in-the-round there isn't a cover but there is a 7 dollar drink/food minimum.  The later shows have a 5 dollar cover.  Either way, it's worth it.  I've always gotten in by waiting in the no-reservation line... I think there are 25 spots for people without reservations but they fill up fast.  Plan to get there an hour ahead if you're in this situation.  When you're at an in-the-round, you'll basically be watching/listening as current singer/songwriters, usually 3 or 4, talk about their work and perform their songs.  They sit in a circle in the middle and trade off performing, sometimes inviting guests up or playing along with each other.  I've always felt that the evening was quality, genuine, and much more interesting than your regular show.  Getting to hear about the motivation/development of a certain song is much more engaging than simply hearing it.  The first time I went to the Bluebird, one of the performers had written for many big-name country singers.  It was bizarre for me to imagine that I had heard a certain song so many times without knowing anything about the person who wrote it or why it was written.  Even if you don't end up learning about or hearing a song you've heard before, an evening at the Bluebird will open your eyes to the songwriting industry and you'll hear some great music to boot.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The bar itself is pretty small, and the tables and chairs are cramped. The crowd arrives pretty early and stays through the evening. This also quite a tourist spot because of the famous songwriters that play here occasionally. My personal impression of the place, is that it is more hype than anything else. The crowd is older and pretentious.  The room is really dark. It is not really a very friendly place. There are now songwriter's nights all over town that are just as good.  If you want to go to the Bluebird to be a part of that history, then by all means visit. But, if all you want is good music, you have a lot of choices all over Music City.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

There was a high gravity stout that my husband was particularly fond of. 14%!My starter salad was comprised of bib lettuce radishes and blue cheese. It seems ordinary, but it comes together in a perfect mixture. It's a wonderful starter.My gnocchi entrée was incredible. It's not a huge portion, but at just $15, it was a real winner. I whole heartedly endorse it.My husband had the steak. It was a 10 ounce portion. Perhaps not the best steak in town, but affordable, and prepared well.The ambiance in the place is nice. It's fairly small. I felt like an old lady when I had to get my iPhone out and use the flashlight feature to read the menu. The exterior of the building could also use some lighting. We parked on Illinois and had to walk around. My footing felt unsure on the bumpy sidewalk.Still, this is a great restaurant. I should mention that we didn't plan to go here in advance. They were able to squeeze us in on a Saturday night with only a 30 minute wait time. I did call it in advance. Really good service too.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I set out on a double date with my husband and friends the other night. We wanted something ethnic and decided on Korea House. We showed up there, and it was closed as they were in Korea for their son's wedding-- authentic. After a quick change of plans, we opted for the new Nations restaurant, Fifty First Kitchen.It was super easy to park, and they were able to seat us right away without a reservation. We sat outside in a very charming little garden. One complaint was that it was very buggy-- they could definitely use a debugging or some citronella!The drink selection was alright, but coming from the owners of Rumours (right?), I was a little disappointed in the selection. The food was, overall, quite good. As a table, we tried the Goat Cheese Sformata (a cheesy custard), Foccacia, the Market Salad, Tagliatelle, Gargati, Grilled Squid, and the Crispy Pork Belly. The Sformata and Foccacia were great starters although rather small. The Market Salad was very fresh. I wasn't huge on the Tagliatelle, but my husband loved it. The Gargati was a big hit. The Grilled Squid, while good, was absolutely tiny-- I would not order this again. My favorite of the night was the Pork Belly. It was also quite a small portion, but it was incredibly flavorful. Overall, while I found the food very tasty, I found the portion size to be lacking, and therefore the overall value lacking.I would love to come back from some cheese and charcuterie (and of course the pork belly!)!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We've just walked in from dinner at Fifty First, and it was absolutely terrific.  Food, service, and ambience are all top-notch.  For those of you who won't read this entire review, here's the summary:  get your reservations now, and when you go, order focaccia.  You'll thank me on both points later.The decor is a gracious renovation of an older space; it is modern but still warm, upscale yet inviting.  The servers are attentive, knowledgeable, and savvy; details of placing and pacing are handled expertly.  All of this allows you to put your full attention where it belongs: on the marvelous food.The menu combines a deep commitment to local and fresh ingredients with a thoughtful approach to small plates.  Some of our favorites were the crispy pig ears atop a lovely bed of greens and the amazing charcuterie with its savory cured meats and crunchy flatbreads.  The focaccia is, hands down, the best I've ever tasted: a pleasantly crusty exterior, a perfectly light and chewy interior, and a spreadable condiment that puts butter to shame.  Get it and don't ask questions.You don't have to subsist solely on small plates; there are also standard-sized entrees.  We saw several fish dishes go by that looked delicious.  The roast chicken (in my view, a good measure of a chef's skill) was heavenly; moist, tender, and seasoned with just the right blend of herbs to make you pick the bone clean.  Try your best to save room for dessert; the mascarpone cheesecake with strawberry sorbet was nothing short of sinful.Fifty First is a great concept with solid execution.  Go.  Order the focaccia.  You don't even have to thank me later.  Just go.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Finally, a Nashville restaurant that I truly enjoyed. A place where one can park, beautiful decor and excellent cuisine. Met a friend for dinner. Had excellent service; attentive but not overly so. Had the chicken liver pate app and the layered flavor was good, but my only criticism is the bread was so tough that I had difficulty eating it. We shared the steak dinner and the risotto. Normally I do not eat steak but it was perfectly cooked and so tender and flavorful. The risotto was a perfect compliment to the steak. The waiter recommend the Horseshoes and Hand Grenades wine. It was a winner and I will be looking for it at my favorite wine store. If you have not tried this place, the go and enjoy.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been celebrating my birthday by going to restaurants that I have been wanting to try. This little gem opened up last summer and it's been on my list. My gal pal and I had a girls night out to celebrate and what a lovely night we had.Coming at 5:45pm, i was the first in the restaurant and the staff welcomed me and asked if I wanted to sit inside or out. We made the right decision and sat outside. The weather was too gorgeous not to be part of it. They have HH until 7pm that includes $5 cocktails and wine + discounted appetizers. This was a pleasant surprise so we decided to order the daily fresh made tomato focaccia bread ($4), pork and veal meatballs in a tomato broth ($4), and gnocchi for starters ($15). The focaccia bread was tasty. I loved the meyer lemon ricotta and oilio santos that was an excellent dip with the focaccia. The (3) pork and veal meatballs were good but I wasn't blown away. It was in a tomato brodo and each meatball was topped with pecorino tuscano. The gnocchi was potato based with a light duck sauce, baby kale, ricotta salata, and shredded duck. I would have liked a plate full of gnocchi. The server was honest about the gnocchi being a small portion. It's a teaser because you'd want another dish if you ordered that for your main.Our mains came out. I ordered the duck and my friend had the trout. The duck was quite tasty and I LOVED the puffed quinoa!!!! OMG! I seriously wanted another scoop or two on my plate. That was so tasty and paired very well with the duck. The squash, scallion, and golden raisin marmelata were nice accents to the dish and I wouldn't have minded another helping of the quinoa and squash. My friend had the NC trout that came with the fennel relish, citrus, and capers. She ate all of her meal and we were feeling pretty good. We didn't feel \"stuffed\" which was nice. We each had two drinks during the meal as well. I would say that coming here and trying several dishes is the way to go. You can easily spend $50-75 per person. The bar is small but nice. I am so glad that I tried it out because it's different and I would be down to go here for HH before 7pm for their $5 drink specials.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Had a male waiting on us and he was the worst waiter I've ever had in Nashville. Forgets our drinks and to bring wine glasses to table. After receiving initial order it took over 40 minutes to get our dinner order in and to track him down for the check was a task. Food quality drastically decreased. Portions tiny on the quail....no chicken on menu....cheese plate didn't have great selections. Again, it was not a good night and the service was terrible.

I forget what my date had, but she thought it was great. We went early and the place was not full, but gradually filled up. There was a much older crowd this time, which may or may not be what the owners are looking for, but it was OK with us.

We tried to be good sports, but realized they KNOW about the fly problem b/c they have bug candles and fans for some tables, but not all of them.  The servers were polite, attentive and apologetic about the flies, but drinks were slow to come and my \"mocktail\" was no more than a short glass filled with ice and club soda for $5.  While the pasta courses were good, the octopus should never have been allowed out of the kitchen, mushy, clearly not fresh, carpaccio was over salted and we weren't given enough \"vehicles\" like bread for our pate and cheese plates. I moved here from a pretty large city known for food, and realize my standards are pretty high. I have no problem paying top dollar for a top notch experience, but unfortunately, the experience didn't match the price.  I live in the neighborhood and was hoping to make this a \"go to\" place when I was wanting something special, but alas, I walked away hungry and disappointed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We sampled most of the small plates: mushroom risotto, pork and lamb meatballs, stuffed quail, pulled pork gnudi, pastrami charcuterie and cheese plate and both desserts. It was all absolutely superb and perfectly complimented by a good bottle of wine. What made this especially unique was the customer service. Their credit card machine was down due to an impromptu storm and the owner offered us our $200 meal as complimentary for the trouble and inability to accommodate the \"chip cards\" this particular evening. Because of the service shown (by both owner and wait staff), in addition to the delicious food, we will be sharing our wonderful experience with anyone that will listen and be sure to come back frequently enough to make it up to them.

The selection at the bar is ample with boutique alcohol and great pasta mix drinks. Service was excellent spite and incredibly busy evening at the restaurant. And at least for now they are serving spiny lobster better known as langoustine, which might be the greatest shell fish of all time. And with regard to the portion size I found them to be perfectly balanced allowing me to eat an appetizer and a pasta without feeling so stuffed I couldn't share desert.

He almost made us feel like we were an inconvenience to him. He acted annoyed with us.  Maybe because we didn't all order drinks and we mostly ordered from the Happy Hour selections so we could just try a few things, rather than entrees. It's not a cheap place and the portions are very small.  After we ordered he said, \"is that all?\". With a bit of a puzzled tone. (We ordered 6 dishes to share) Then when we asked to split the check after dinner, he acted put out and said, \"what do you mean split the check\". It was just odd, especially since I asked him about splitting the check before we even ordered. THEN, when we got up to leave, not ONE person thanked us for coming in or said goodbye as we walked RIGHT BY THEM.  All three of us girls were non impressed by that and the place was pretty empty. The food was good, but definitely not good enough to go back OR recommend to someone else. There are FAR too many great places in Nashville popping up all over to check out. This was on my list of places to try out, but I can now unfollow on Instagram because I was not impressed. I don't mean to come across all negative, but I would think if you're a new place that is trying to grow your business AND a great word of mouth you would try to make your guests feel very welcome and that was far from how we felt.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We started with the cheese and charcuterie board, which had homemade lavash crackers and some accompanying honey with black pepper. Those special touches distinguished it from any run of the mill board. And the che'fs selections were fantastic.We also ordered the tomato focaccia, which was straight from the oven and seasoned perfectly. It came with a delicious ricotta and lemon side spread that was out of this world. The cool cheese spread on the warm bread and all of the components came together perfectly.My husband ordered the gnocchi with duck ragu. The waiter had described the gnocchi as \"light as pillows\", which is hard to accomplish - but they were. Light and delicious, complemented beautifully by the duck ragu.I ordered the risotto with mushrooms. Though it was tasty, I found it a tad bit salty. My husband disagreed when he tasted it so it could very well have been me. But when the waiter asked whether I liked my dish (as he could see I hadn't eaten much), I told him honestly that it was a bit salty for me and he immediately asked if he could substitute it with something else. I declined but it was a sincere and generous offer.We ordered the chocolate ganache with polenta ice cream for dessert. The chef came out to apologize for the risotto and said that the dessert was on the house. I told him that it was probably just my taste buds, but he said he was new and appreciated the feedback. It was a very nice touch. On top of that, the dessert was delicious. The chocolate had been smoked, and paired with caramel, chocolate nibs, and the polenta ice cream. Tasted separately, each piece of the dessert was delicious, but when eaten all together in one bite, it was a completely different and also delicious experience. In addition to our server, we found all of the staff to be very friendly and the atmosphere to be cozy and comfortable. We will definitely return!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We were in town visiting and heard the food at this restaurant was tasty, which is was. The reason I am giving a 1 star review is due to the unprofessional service I received after. We had the bill split three ways and upon checking my bank statement days later, I noticed I was charged the entire price of the bill on my card, despite the receipt I signed only giving authorization to charge 1/3rd of the bill. I thought maybe the other two girls had not been charged but they had each been charged the proper amount. So on our $120 dollar bill, the restaurant charged us $200 dollars.  Upon calling the restaurant, I was told a manager would call me back either that night or the next morning and received no return phone call. It took me calling THREE more times and leaving a voicemail where it was apparent I was upset for a return phone call. Again because I did not answer the first time I was called, it seemed nearly impossible to get ahold of someone when I called back. I still have yet to speak to someone on the phone, but was given a managers EMAIL address and told I would be mailed a check for the difference. Aside from it being very unprofessional that it took one whole week to be EMAILED by a manager, the fact that a check for the difference would be mailed seems very inconvenient as I will have to take time out of my work week to make it to the bank to deposit this when it was a mistake made by the restaurant. To top it off, the same thing happened to the other three with as at dinner who split the bill-- one being charged the entirety of the bill and the other two still being charged their portions. I feel as though a prompt call from the manager would have settled the mistake without leaving a very upset customer. At this point, I  feel as though we should have been reimbursed for the entire bill. So yes food recommended but MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BANK STATEMENT AFTER VISITING THIS RESTAURANT!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Ordered Foie gras and focaccia appetizers, which were both good, but not sure that they were anything really special. Portion sizes for the appetizers were good though. I had the cavatelli with rabbit sausage pasta as an entree, but ended up eating some of my wife's steak, as the pasta dish was pretty small. To be fair, the waiter did mention that the pastas were not exactly full entree sized. Pasta was good, but a bit on the salty side. My wife had the steak, which was one of the most expensive items on the menu at 32 bucks. It was cooked to a good medium as requested, and had decent flavor, except that all but two slices were extremely tough. After wearing our jaws out chewing steak, we paid out $100 tab and left. The meal was certainly not a very memorable NYE dinner, and disappointing in that we had high expectations.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I had the Acapulco cocktail which was great and my wife had one of their two beers offered. They had an ipa and a red both of which were pretty heavy considering it is 90 degrees out. We ordered the duck liver pate that was great; it is served with brioche slices which tend to be a little heavy when accompanied with pate. We also had the pork belly on a bed of grains mixed with a mustardy sauce (the belly was great but the grains needed seasoning and were on the drier side). Next was the gnocchi which was tasty; it had a light sauce with bits of pulled pork and greens. Lastly we ordered the tagliatelle which was the overall best dish of the night. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the runny egg yolk on top worked well to create a deliciously delicate sauce. The restaurant is definitely worth a try.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The candlelight reflecting off wood surfaces and the music selection added warmth and welcome.  As to the sublime flavors, textures, and presentation of their rustic Italian dishes, well- you'll just have to make a visit as there are no words sufficient to convey our joyful experience. From the foccaccia-of-perfection to panzanella with charred-pepper vinaigrette, to pork-and-lamb sausage with tender field peas, the Chocolate Bombe and strong, earthy french press coffee, there wasn't a note out of tune in this culinary symphony.  Last but not least, Caroline's masterminding of artisanal cocktails.

I made a reservation immediately after I saw on the website that fifty first was \"dressing up\" as a Chicago-style popup Italian restaurant, Mama G's. I read all of the reviews on Yelp, and figured I couldn't go wrong. In what used to be a dicey neighborhood, fifty first has a cool wine bar vibe. I loved that the music is all played from vinyl, and the place was packed and noisy but not obnoxiously loud. My date and I could talk, mostly about how good the food was, just fine. As mentioned in other reviews, the service was excellent. Caring without being a hovering drone, our waitress did a great job of keeping an eye on us and timing food. We had the antipasto salad - house cured charcuterie with Bibb lettuce. Dressing was light and seasoning spot on. The real stars were the charcuterie and the house pickled veggies. We also had the baked rigatoni and the spaghetti and meatballs. Nice entree sizes and also very tasty. As good as what I have had in New York, Boston, and Chicago. This was great American-Italian, not exactly like Italy-italian, but it was perfectly matched to how it was advertised as Chicago-Italian. Finished with a scoop of pistachio gelato, which was great - not too sugary, and roasted pistachios for crunch on top. Overall: High quality, attention to detail, no complaints, and I will be back soon for the regular menu.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The highlights for me were:- Very nicely executed old fashion, and I tried my gf's tequila based cocktail. It was delicious as well.- The Brussels sprouts are some of the best I have had anywhere. They were the best food highlight for me.- I had a bolognese dish that was very good and nicely done. My gf out ordered me and got a beef cheek dish with risotto that was melt in your mouth. Overall, I would absolutely eat here again when I'm back in town.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

There's valet parking so it was so easy to just drive up and go straight to eating! The valet even let us pick up the car after roaming around the neighborhood for a bit. Our reservations were at 11:30 and the place was already packed so it's good to make a reservation prior to coming. We could not decide between the pecan sticky buns and cinnamon sugar doughnuts so our waitress made the choice easy for us and told us to go with the sticky buns. Best choice ever. Do not leave without trying the sticky buns. Careful, they're hot though so don't get too excited!This is a brunch spot that had so many wonderful options on the menu and the couple next to our table ordered a few items so we asked them how their food was. They said they loved everything and had the same difficulty we did in deciding what to get. After I was done bothering the couple next to us, I was having a sweet tooth based on their recommendation so I ordered the buttermilk waffle and quiche to split with my sister. I also ordered a bloody mary and it was not only refreshing but the okra pickle was probably the best part. The waffle was tasty but I'm not sure if I would spend $13 to get it again although the spiced apples were delicious. Perhaps I had already overdone the sweetness by starting with the sticky buns. The quiche was on par though and balanced everything out. I recommend ordering the sticky buns or waffle to share with someone because it's worth trying (without getting a sugar overload) and then having eggs or quiche as the main course.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Wine list is on par with what others in town charge (although $11 for a glass of grenache that retails for $18 is a bit much). Might be me, but the food portions seem smaller each time. They have changed the salad (they only offer one!) and I did not care for it. The duck dish was absolutely delicious but the portion is so small. Faro is an inexpensive grain and the breast was about half the size I'm accustomed to getting. It's unfortunate to leave a restaurant with a $77 check and still be hungry. Not sure I will return although I love supporting the neighborhood restaurants.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We ordered both the beets and buffalo cauliflower for appetizers which were mouth watering and very filling. My husband ordered the duck breast for his main while I ordered the scallops. The duck breast was expertly cooked, beautifully presented and very, very tasty. My scallop dish was equally divine, however, I was very surprised to see that each of the scallops were sliced in half. The portion size was not generous and very pricey considering I was served 3 scallops for $28. Since when does a restaurant cut your scallops in half? Disappointing and why I can't give this restaurant 5 stars.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "When we hear from other folks about a restaurant that is consistently good, we'll get around to it, sooner or later.  That's what happened when we were looking for a date night out and saw that Josephine in 12South had an open reservation.We started with the pretzel bread, served with mustard, and crispy pork belly, served with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil.  Both were delicious!  I think the pretzel bread was my favorite; I wanted to take a loaf home! For my main dish, I was a little more adventurous, choosing the beef cheeks dish.  It was like a tender, rich pot roast.  I'd never had beef cheeks before, so it was a great first intro to a different cut of meat.  I'm not sure it's something I'll crave, but I wouldn't hesitate to try another dish with them.We were a little torn on dessert; after all, Jeni's is next door and we don't get to have that very often!  But when we saw that they had a special peach cobbler on the menu, which you had to order 30 minutes in advance, I was like \"yes, please\" and we made the call.  Not to mention, you can't go wrong when you order what's in season!The cobbler was more like a mini pie, served with vanilla ice cream to make it a la mode. It was perfect for two people, and the perfect way to enjoy a summer date night.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My husband and I made reservations for Josephine's tonight for our one year anniversary dinner. The menu had something for a pescatarian and a vegetarian which prompted us to choose this place to celebrate our special occasion. The location of the restaurant is and isn't ideal. It is because it is in a popular, \"young\" neighborhood which leads to attraction and a \"foodie\" clientele. It's not ideal because the popularity of the neighborhood leads to minimal to no parking spaces. Luckily, they do offer complimentary valet parking, which we took advantage of. When we walked it, it was obviously very busy. Thankfully, we called ahead for reservations so we were seated immediately. Where we were sitting was a bit quieter than the rest of the place but still a bit loud. To serve up some ambiance, there was dim lighting and votive candles at each table but that's about it. It was almost industrial looking - I didn't feel like I was on a romantic date. I ordered a glass of Riesling while the hubby ordered the Yeuling Lager. We followed those with the buffalo cauliflower, the pretzel bread (a house favorite from what I can see), the swordfish, and the butternut squash ravioli. I highly laud the bread - it's quite rightfully earned its reputation, especially with that sweet and tangy dipping sauce. The cauliflower was delicious - my only complaints were that the hot sauce can be overpowering and there wasn't as much bleu cheese as I wanted. The swordfish was solid - cooked well (just the tiniest bit dry) with a light, salty, and herby sauce. The ravioli was sweet, buttery, and nutty, but I liked my food better. While I liked the fish, I can't help but think the flavors were a bit one dimensional. The service was great - all smiles and helpful advice. It was a bit pricy but we expected that. The cutest thing was they gave us complimentary molasses cookies along with the recipe. Adorable. Overall, I might come back - try out any menu changes. Other than that, eh. Good effort though.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been meaning to review this place for a while now. I've been here twice. Once with some friends from Texas and the second time was for a networking dinner. One thing I really like about it, is that they do seasonal menus. And I'm not talking about changing one or two things, they change the whole menu depending on what ingredients are in season. I love that!It's been a while since I was here, last fall I believe. But I had a really good experience. The ambiance is hipster chic, which is perfect for the 12 south area. All the wait staff were wearing plaid shirts, let the dished and bar itself was pretty upscale.For appetizers we ordered these pretzel things and a beet salad. I'm not a huge fan of beets, so I didn't necessarily like the salad. But the pretzels were delicious. I then ordered the steak and frites, which were delicious. The serving size wasn't huge, but it was pretty rich. The steak was cooked perfectly and it had some sort of a garlic aioli on top of it. The fries were perfect. I have been meaning to return to try their winter menu, and plan on going back soon!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I arrived early and they were flexible, always a good sign of things to come. Had first course of butter lettuce wedge and Brussels sprouts off small plates menu, entree was scallops. Portions are right sized but generous, scallops were cooked perfectly, tender, moist and not rubbery. Handed little sack of cookies on way out. Quiet enough to be able to talk during dinner, which is rarity. Great food, great folks, nice menu and wine list. Highly recommend.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was dressed in a T shirt which I folded my hands across myself and apologized for my dress down Saturday Brunch version of myself. Thoroughly embarressed, we still wanted to come in. The hostess could not have been more accomodating and I asked to sit in the back with no one seeing my Genesis Bible quote t shirt. Server just as nice and accomodating. After we left I did notice others who did not dress the Nice Saturday Brunch  attire either. Brunch menu was not the largest, so we both had the crab cake benedict. It was very good, and I requested no Hollandaise. Can not speak to that. Very good crab cake, bread is bread and and the soft boiled egg was perfect. Mimosa and Bloody Mary were the cheapest I think for that Saturday. I had wine because I do. Decent fair price on wine too. For the price, I think it is spot on for the dining and the experience and the service. So glad they allow T shirts.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Mehhhh. That's how I feel about Josephine. I popped in for brunch with friends, literally 3 minutes after they opened and the hostess told me there would be a long wait for a table. Huh? What? I asked the hostess why there was a long wait, did we need reservations (their website does not explicitly state you need reservations for brunch...as most places don't), she then gave me a confusing answer....\"Umm yes, well kinda. sometimes you do and sometimes you don't\". WHAT? I felt like I was in an alternate reality - nothing was making sense. Luckily, there were seats at the bar so we plopped down there. I ordered a mimosa - it was really good. The guys in our group ordered some type of Bourbon based drink and loved it. The bartender knew what he was doing. I then ordered an omelette (it came with fries and a side salad). When it came out, it was not an omelette at all. It was scrambled eggs with cheese inside with mushrooms, peppers, and onions on top (barely). It was slimy and gooey...definitely not what an omelette should be. My life felt like a lie. The fries were WAY too over salted. It was gross. The only good thing about that meal was the salad. One person in my group ordered the Josephine Benedict...surprise! The eggs weren't cooked correctly (le sigh..here we go again). The two guys in our group ordered the fried chicken and fried catfish and enjoyed their dishes. Oh, also, it was all very over priced. They could have at least cooked they eggs correctly when they are charging that much. I feel like Josephine could be a really get brunch spot if they got their act together. Maybe our experience was a fluke, maybe it wasn't. I'll be steering clear for a while though.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My boyfriend and I made reservations at Josephine for New Years Eve 2016. When we arrived, we were seated quickly and were taken by the glowing ambiance of this restaurant. It is a clean and hip establishment in the nice area of 12 south. Our service was great and speedy, too. For the most part, it was a lovely time. Let me explain further why I did not give Josephine a five-star rating. As a vegetarian, this was a difficult menu for me. My only option, for an entree, was the hazelnut ravioli. It was delicious. However - if you are a hungry non-meat eater - I wouldn't come here. When our plates arrived, my boyfriend got a big, hearty porter road pork chop. When my plate was sat, I noticed only five raviolis. A very small portion that I was not warned would be so small. I finished my meal in 3-5 minutes, while my boyfriend was finished in about 10-15 minutes. I left hungry and disappointed because given that it was New Years Eve, no other place was open and I had nothing to eat at home. My boyfriend was happy with the portion size, at $29.00. He said that while his pork chop was tasty, it was not very tender. My meal at only $3.00 less, was very good, but as before mentioned, not worth the price due to the small portion size. It doesn't seem fair that my entree was $27.00 and the portion size was so much smaller. In contrast of these two meals (meat VS. non-meat plate), my entree should have cost less, or rather, should have been under the small plates section. I would never consider the hazelnut ravioli as an entree. If you do, you will be disappointed. Overall, I would not recommend Josephine to my fellow vegetarian and vegan friends.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our table had pasta, beef cheeks and duck breast. I loved the beef cheeks! It was definitely a table favorite. Very very tender. The duck breast was really good too, but I wasn't ecstatic about it. The pasta had a very strong flavor. For me it was amazing, however it wasn't for everyone at the table. When it came to food quality, this place was really great. The environment was also really nice. They have a good wine selection. The service was debatable. Our waiter started off pretty good. He was on top of it. He had good knowledge of the menu. However our wine glasses went empty (all 3 of us) and he never came by to take care of it. There was a girl who bussed our table who ended up taking our wine order. It just seemed to take forever to get service. Having worked as a water in both the lowest quality restaurants and in fine dining, letting drinks go empty is a big \"no no\". We weren't unhappy per se. We just weren't impressed by the service. And it really wasn't very busy. However maybe they're just understaffed. I don't know.

I got the rabbit and while I still feel guilty for eating a bunny it was delicious. The food is well presented and all very rich.

Both bartenders were so attentive, talkative and knowledgable of the menu.Drinks were amazing. The food was very good. We had crispy pork belly for an appetizer, I had the filet, and my friend had the beef cheeks on risotto. Definitely a lot of salt, which I generally stay away from. On a good note, I drank a ton of water...lol. I would return for sure just to sit down, have a great drink and some appetizers over a wonderful conversation with friends. Perfect atmosphere for that.

    "comments": "My Birthday was this past Sunday and my girlfriend surprised me with a reservation for dinner at Josephine. Honestly, this restaurant was a perfect place to spend my 21st birthday because it was a nice upscale restaurant with dim lighting and excellent service as well. The restaurant was not too noisy and has nice booth seating by the window. I ordered the Josephine Daiquiri, which was my first alcoholic drink ever. Personally, I thought there was a bit too much grapefruit flavoring in the cocktail, but other than that it the tequila was definitely intense and flavorful. For the small plates (appetizers) we ordered the Nashville hot scrapple and the beef tongue. I'm still not sure what the scrapple was but I can tell you that it was extremely flavorful and soft, so I highly recommend trying it if you visit. Now onto the beef tongue, I was initially a bit skeptical about trying this, but my girlfriend loves eating beef tongue so we got it anyway haha. Honestly, I was blown away by the amount of flavor that the beef tongue had, it literally just tasted like sliced meat. There was a barbeque-like taste about it that was complemented really well with the horseradish cream sauce. After a delicious round of small plates, we had our entrees, which consisted of grilled swordfish and scallops. Honestly, I think these two are the best entrees here. The grilled swordfish had a decent size portion and was cooked so that the fish was very tender and soft. The swordfish was not too salty and went well with the sauce and assorted vegetables associated with the dish. However, the scallops definitely stole the show. I think that both my girlfriend and I would agree that the scallops tasted the best. Unfortunately, the scallop entree portion only comes with 4 pieces (fancy restaurant portions), but it packs so much flavor that you want to order another portion. The corn sauce combined with the scallops made the tender scallops taste even better and further accentuated its natural flavors. I highly recommend trying the scallops because even if you don't like scallops, this dish will make you fall in love with them. Overall, Josephine was an amazing place to spend my birthday and if you're in the mood to celebrate a special occasion, definitely check this place out!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My overall thought is that the food was just okay. I don't mind paying more money for great food, but here I thought it was overpriced for what you got. My friend and I split several things including:-Bloomy Rind cheese plate, Josephine bar nuts, country bread - good, but like any other cheese plate; nothing stood out-Fresh jumbo lump crab, grilled/chilled beans, brown butter hollandaise - would have been good if the beans were burnt giving the whole dish a charred flavor-Pappardelle, Border Springs lamb, parmesan - the noodles were very good but the sauce was just okay and seemed grainy (could have been the lamb but I'm not certain -Peach cobbler for 2, Peach Truck peaches, vanilla bean ice cream - the cobbler filling was okay, the crust was really good, and the ice cream was awesome (definitely the best part of the whole meal).We had a reservation at 5:30 so we went before the crowd, but the service was still a little slow (not including the cooking time for the peach cobbler as they tell you prior to ordering that it will take 30mins to make). I don't think ill be back unless it's for drinks and dessert.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The service, ambiance, and food were all incredible!  My friend and I had reservations before a show and decided to share some of the small plates and one entree. It was so much food!!  Much more than we had expected. We were both intrigued by the beef tongue and found it incredibly delicious. It is served with a horseradish cream sauce and while I don't usually love horseradish, I loved this. In all honesty, I could have licked this plate clean. The brussels sprouts were our next favorite dish. We also shared the buffalo cauliflower, spaetzel, and the salmon. I loved the buffalo cauliflower and the spaetzel. The salmon was good, but the crab salad it was served on left much to be desired. I would definitely recommend Josephine!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been here four or five times now and always have a consistently good meal. The atmosphere here may be my favorite part-- it's gorgeous, darkly lit, and feels cozy. It's perfect for a date night or a nice dinner out with parents. As for the food, everything has been tasty, with some dishes being more well balanced than others. Overall, the vegetables are always standouts. I'm a huge fan of their Buffalo Cauliflower. It's done a few places around town, but theirs is roasted and a little healthier seeming. Their Brussels are flavor bombs, and the salad options are light and flavorful. On our last visit, my husband had the Pork Chop, and it was one of the tastiest cuts of meat I have ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and seared-- I would highly recommend this for a heartier meal. Some mid-points are their pasta and fish dishes. To me, the pastas have been unbalanced. The Spaetzle was too mustardy and tart, and the Agnolotti too sweet. The fish dishes have also seemed small for the price. Service is always very friendly and competent.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Josephine in two words:  \"it's lit.\"Ah, I found my way back in 12th South neighborhood, remarking at once at the rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods replete with requisite graffiti, ice cream parlors, barbershops and boutique ladies' wares in Tetris arrangements among new apartments and old free standing structures of unknown zoning.  At the center of the 2300 block is Josephine, a place I'd serendipitously heard while ear hustling a convo I'm a hotel lobby.  The name was enough to recall a recommended destination from a Sky magazine I flipped through somewhere on the other side of the country.  With no time for coincidence I found parking nearby and made a short stroll to be extra nosey instead of handing off to the valet directly in front of the establishment.  But inside I quickly understood the hype and quickly noted the handsome bar area holding court with patrons and newcomers like myself spiraled about its dark wooded and marbled glory.  12 South was now \"urban chic\"...write it down. Greeted and seated with immediacy (thank God for early brunch) we were entertained by the likes of Otis Redding crooning just above the noise of the growing crowd which looked like mostly extras from a new dating site commercial.  Our waitress Carol popped in and out with precision and managed to be both cool and warm with her recommendations of what was good and great. For starters?  Donuts in cinnamon and sugar...followed by a Bellini and a Seelbach--bourbon (four roses), sparkling wine and bitters.  I was impressed they were ably to girlie-up the bourbon and not muster a single complaint from me.   Next we moved to the fried oyster sandwich, honeyed yogurt (djm!!) and crab cake sandwich with fries.  Oysters and bacon are a serious love affair of mine and Josephine didn't disappoint.  Of all the things I think the fries were the only passable item as they had been far too salty to be taken seriously, especially given the silky soulful ambiance. One thing I noticed was that the bar brings it and my next time through will either be a liquid lunch--there are two other signature cocktails with mezcal--or an early evening social hour to park and graze centerstage at the bar. I remember the neighborhood before it was a \"thing\" with this crowd but I'll not tell its secrets just yet.  I will, however, be back.  Easy 4 stars on everything... Let's hope it lasts.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "It was great! Tried this place Valentines weekend.  We booked our reservation through open table for 9:45. We were seated soon as we arrived.  We ordered the chicken wings, bib salad, beef cheeks, sangria and dessert. This was off their regular menu.I don't think they had a special menu for Valentines Day. Anywho, the chicken wings with chow chow and pickled radish. were very tasty. It was about 6-8 wings. I had the bib salad minus the bacon (I don't eat pork). The salad was a good size. It was stacked high with buttermilk ranch drizzled all over. With croutons and radishes.The beef cheeks came with 5 baby potatoes and a sauce. It was sooooo tender. My goodness it melted in your mouth. The potatoes were good as well and the sauce was perfect. The dessert was not listed on the menu, the waiter advised it was new. It had 3 layers of chocolate and peanut butter mousse. I have no idea what it was called but it was very popular that night and VERY good. I'll post a picture. Overall the service was great, the atmosphere was very nice and modern. Our bill was a little over $100.00 which was expected.  My only complaint was I wanted more food. I would definitely return and try a different dish and drinks. I've seen good reviews about other dishes. I like this place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We walked in and right up to a couple of seats at the large bar and were welcomed by the bartender. She gave us brunch and drink menus and chatted with us about her favorite savory/sweet brunchy items. I settled on the spinach and goat cheese quiche [$13] and my other half was drooling over the chef's \"hangover cure\" Combo #1=beef cheek gravy, fries, sunny egg with a small glass of beer [$19]. The coffee and grapefruit mimosas [perfect ratio of bubbles to a splash of juice] were wonderful.

    "comments": "A solid four star experience for sure. On our visit to Nashville we stayed just off 12 South in walking distance of Josephine. We arrived in town on Halloween, and I didn't really want to do the Halloween party scene, so instead I opted to use it as a night for a nicer dinner, figuring that reservations might be easier to come by later in the evening since everyone else would be getting their Halloween party started. I made reservations via Open Table for 7:30 pm a week or two beforehand. We arrived and were seated immediately but the hostess. The atmosphere here was exactly what I was looking for to kick of my vacation: warm, welcoming, and upscale, without being pretentious or stuffy. The bar area is very pretty, and we were seated at a table along the side wall with one side being a bench with pillows. Overall I would say it's a chic rustic feel.Our waitress was very friendly giving us an opportunity to look over the wine list as she got us water. We went with a pinot grigio as I  figured I would probably be having fish. The menu here is a little bit confusing to me. Small plates are listed first, and while some are obvious pre meal/appetizer selections others seemed to me that they would be better suited as sides. Regardless we placed our small plate orders, one Bloomy Rind cheese plate (which to me is a perfect pre meal option) and one order of Brussels sprouts (which I kind of felt would have been better suited to come with the meal as a side...I'm sure I could have asked for this to be done though). Our wine arrived, and I appreciated our waitress asking if I liked my white wine to be ice cold so that the ice bucket would suit our needs (I do like my white wine VERY cold). We enjoyed a few sips before the small plates arrived. Our cheese plate consisted of a blue cheese gouda blend (blouda, the waitress joked), a hard goat's milk cheese, and a nutty aged cheddar. The cheese plate also came with a few slices of toast as well as a trail mix with dried fruits and nuts. The platter, though $17 is well worth it for the size as it could easily serve as an app for four people, or be shared at the bar between two for drinks. Pre-meal we weren't quite able to finish it despite my normal \"no cheese left behind\" mentality. The fruits is the trail mix went great with the goat cheese and the blouda was delicious on the toast crisps. There was quite a bit of the trail mix on the plate (maybe a bit too much, but one cannot complain about too much) but my favorite part of it was the walnuts. They had a smoky/sweet/roasted quality to them that was delicious. Now on to the Brussels sprouts. Though I felt the vegetable small plates might go best brought with the entrees, putting the blouda cheese on a few of the Brussels sprouts was quite a hit. As for the sprouts themselves they were perfectly cooked with a little bit of a char along with some sweet cherries, a peanut vinaigrette, and a breadcrumb topping. I wanted to lick the peanut vinaigrette from the bowl when the sprouts were gone.  Entrees were delivered in good timing as we had just decided we couldn't eat any more cheese with more food coming. I opted for the Scottish salmon which was served over a bed of riced cauliflower with raisins and topped with crispy shallots. The salmon was cooked perfectly and had a great buttery texture. I wasn't crazy about the cauliflower/raisin situation as I'm not that into sweet things being part of my entree, but unique, and with the perfection to which the salmon was cooked I was more than satisfied. I had been deciding between the salmon and the scallops and when I saw another table get the scallops I was a little bit jealous, but the grass is always greener... My boyfriend opted for the pappardelle pasta which was served with a lamb bolognese. I could tell this dish was just what he had hoped for and he was really impressed with it. Though I ended up eating fish, I had inquired about vegetarian options at the start of the meal and the waitress noted that their risotto could be made vegetarian, and that I could chose any of the small plate vegetable options and they could assemble an entree for me that way.The desserts here looked absolutely amazing, but coupling the fact that we knew we couldn't decide on just one, and the amount of cheese we ate before the entree, we decided to skip it rather than make ourselves sickeningly full. The service here was great, and like the atmosphere was welcoming and upscale without being pretentious. Our waitress had a great personality and  was happy to make recommendations. Josephine is a great choice for dinner in this neighborhood, and I would love to be able to do their ten by ten tasting if I am ever back in the area. I would also be very satisfied to do wine and a cheese plate at the bar.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Knowledgeable and able to describe taste and textures well. Parking with valet is just outside the door. App was tasty! Never had scrapple and look forward to having it again. My bride didn't enjoy it as much as me but she's picky about texture more than I am. Great flavor though according to both of use. We decided on surf and turf for main course. Meaning, steak for me and scallops for her and we share. Really nice steak! Skirt is one of my two favorites. Scallops were delicious! A sweeter dish so the steak and fries balanced it well. We ordered the Brussels sprouts as others suggested and she said they were really good. Not a huge fan of them personally (in general, not particular to this meal). Love to have a dessert ordered in advance so worthy of a quick pic. Opted for the angel food cake as that sounded best to my bride and is a bit nostalgic for me from childhood. Nice surprise to have cookies as you Wally out the door with the recipe! We will make these soon as I enjoyed them much! We will be back... hopefully quarterly!

The portions were also very generous, much bigger than other expensive restaurants!My boyfriend and I started with the cheese plate and the Brussels sprouts. We are huge fans of cheese and loved the 3 different kinds. Unfortunately, I don't remember what they were, but there was a softer one that reminded me of Brie that was amazing. I wish the bread was softer instead of being like a cracker because I think it would have complemented the bread well. The nuts were tasty!The Brussels sprouts were one of my favorite parts of the meal. It was a big bowl with the most delicious dressing. I loved all the little pieces of fruit in it because it was a very thick dish, and the fruit really lightened it up.I got the beef cheek and my boyfriend got the steak with French fries. The beef cheek was very tender and I loved the sauce, although it did get cloyingly powerful after a while. I wish there were more root veggies served with it to lighten up the sauce! The potatoes were a good complement to lighten the sauce as well.My boyfriends steak was delicious and the sea salt was the perfect, simple seasoning to bring out its flavors. We were too full for dessert, but they gave us some molasses cookies on the house to take home. Great service and great food!!! Highly recommend. The only thing I would say is to be prepared for very strong flavors.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our server couldn't have been less engaged.  When first approached maybe 5 minutes after seated, I wasn't sure if she was just there to fill-up the water glasses or what.  No introduction, no welcome, no review of the menu just \"have you dined here before\".  When asked questions about a few plates the answer was lacking detail.  Either she is painfully shy or having a bad night (though it was very early evening).  It pretty much took any and all \"personality\" out of the dining experience, which to me can be as important as the food.  I'm Not changing my rating of the restaurant overall, just expressing a concern.  Thanks.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "DUUUUUDE. If you try anything at this place, it needs to be the brussels sprouts. You've never had brussels sprouts like this. This place also has my favorite cocktail: the Argentine Cola. Let me lead with that. The vibe/decor in this place is on. point. The warmth and richness of the chosen color pallet exude comfort...which goes perfectly with the food. It's like you're in a cozy, chic cave that's filled with amazing food. The warmth is furthered by the amazing staff. Every experience I've had with the staff has been a pleasant one so far. I believe I've been here a total of three times over the years: twice for dinner and once for drinks + snacks. My first time here, I got steak and fries because...how can you go wrong with that? The steak was exactly the way I like it. Now let's talk about the second dinner experience I had here: beef cheeks. Lawwwwwd, the beef was so tender that it was just falling apart. If you're a pot roast person, GET THE BEEF CHEEKS. It's a very well done, classic and comforting dish. You nailed it, guys. My husband got the duck and he absolutely loved it. Like, eyes closed, chewing. Then dessert happened. We tried the pistachio cake with a phyllo pastry on top, rose creme and cranberry sorbet on the side. I haven't been able to stop thinking about to this day and I'm feeling the urge to run there right now. I shouldn't write reviews when I'm hungry. Last, I ventured into the bar area on an icy night to meet a friend for catching up over drinks. I had a great glass of malbec and we shared the cheese plate. It was fantastic! The cheese plate came with lots of crusty bread and a fruit/nut mixture that I absolutely loved. The secret? Old Bay. I would never think to put Old Bay on fruit and nuts but man oh man it changed me. I don't live far from the 12 South area so thank you, Josephine for planting your flag into the neighborhood. I'm so glad you're here!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Their menu is interesting but not at the expense of taste. We've had experiences at other restaurants where the chefs seem to show off a little much and the result is a complicated plate of food that lacks flavor. Not the case with Josephine. We brought friends here from Minneapolis and everyone raved. On top of that, I can't have dairy/soy and the chefs and our waitress went above and beyond to deliver an excellent experience with so many options.

    "comments": "This new farm to table Brooklyn-esque restaurant in Nashville's 12 South serves some very creative and delicious tapas as well as entrees. This restaurant sets a new standard for tapas in Nashville, a culinary style still somewhat missing from Nashville's tables where large portions rule the day. I'm glad Josephine is here. We chose to begin the evening with the carrots and scrapple appetizers -- and honestly I wish that we had stopped there. Those both are the two best dishes that we ate all evening. The carrots are the single best carrots ever served -- chargrilled and candied before served in a stack. These are a must for every diner. The scrapple consisted of a crab-cake like fried patty of Pennsylvania scrapple served over a spicy cream sauce. We loved the combination of the spiciness of this dish with the sweetness of the carrots. We also enjoyed the duck wings; however, for me, they had a slightly pungent taste that I did not prefer. The beef tongue also was delicious, sweet and tender. Most disappointing to me were the dumplings, which seemed to me to be nothing more than some pasta and asparagus with some fettiuccini sauce over them -- forgive me, but it just seemed that simple. Be warned: the wine and cocktail prices here are New York / LA prices. I live in NYC, and I rarely pay $14 for a glass of red wine as I paid here. Owners should reconsider their slightly above market prices.All in all, a great experience, friendly service and delicious food. Was there anything so good that I would crave to have it again? The carrots. Beyond those, not really. Despite this, the restaurant is beautiful, the food was great, and has lots of possibilities - so I'll give it a try again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I sat at the very back corner of the bar, alone, expecting to be ignored because it's the most hidden bar spot and a barrier of glass ware and wine bottles separated me from the bartenders (and in my experience, loners are typically seen as unimportant to staff). Boy was that expectation shattered. To keep it short, my bartenders (Austin and Ryan) both respectively made me a delicious Negroni and Vieux Carré, two of my favorites. The beef tongue was wonderful and I asked Ryan to decide my entreé since I wanted every dish on the menu. He did not do me wrong. He combined the risotto from the duck dish with the beef cheeks and my life was made complete. Rich and creamy risotto with earthy and savory beef cheeks with a hint of sweet from the squash in the risotto made this dish unstoppable. I will absolutely be back with a future date or just with friends I want to impress. Because this was an impressive meal. Thank you, Josephine.

There is a side area that has large glass windows, so you feel like you're on a patio but you are still in the air conditioning. The kitchen is open, so you can observe as they cook. They have an extensive wine list and standard cocktails. I probably should not have picked champagne by the glass, it was pretty standard. My favorite part of the meal were our starters. We chose the cheese plate, which came with three fabulous selections that change. My favorite was the goat cheese, it was delicious. The toast that came with it was a little too hard and hurt my teeth trying to bite into it. I would have liked something a little easier to chew. The gazpacho with crab was really tasty, possibly a little overpowering to where it bordered on tasting more like a salsa. But I still really enjoyed it. It was green and somewhat spicy. They serve a good portion of it. I enjoyed it. For my entrée, I had the scallops. They were cooked nicely and they didn't add too many flavors so that I could taste the natural flavor of the scallops. The Caesar salad was a wedge of romaine lettuce that they had lightly charred and added some dressing and shaved parmesan. It was kind of underwhelming. My husband ordered the steak. It came with fries that tasted like they had truffle oil and parmesan. Unfortunately, the cut of steak was not impressive. They don't identify the cut on the menu, and he wished that he had asked. He felt like they cut corners on the meat selection, so he was a bit disappointed. I tasted it, and while it was fine, it wasn't anything special. It came with a big wedge of herbed butter on top of it, which he scraped off (it wasn't melted). As far as the service, we didn't have any complaints. That said, no one we interacted with was particularly friendly. From the hostess to the waiting staff, everyone seemed pretty dry. For a restaurant that holds itself out to be high caliber, I would expect a little more emphasis on the personal side of service. That said, no one was rude or anything. All in all, while I enjoyed our meal, it didn't quite meet our hopes for that price range.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We began with coffee to drink, and I loved the cute Nashville mugs they brought them out in! I ordered the goat cheese & spinach quiche and it was definitely a good choice! It came with a side salad and fries and that was really the perfect combination. Most of the time when I order an omelette or quiche, I am only able to eat about half of the portion because I just get tired of it or it is too much. But the portions were perfect here and the greens and fries complemented the dish well.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The corn medley underneath was a little chilly I don't know if that was intentional or not but I think I would've liked it better hot. The duck was also cooked perfectly and I recommend it. I don't recommend the pork belly. I've had pork belly done dozens of different ways in many different places. This one wasn't gross, but it's my least favorite. It was a little tough, and the delicious fatty juiciness that is Pork belly was lost in the \"chicken Parmesan\" style prep. Overall it was a good experience.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Sometimes I forget how amazing food can be, and why it is ranked among the top three pleasures in life (you can fill in the blanks of the other two). Thank you, Josephine.

All candlelight and a fabulous sideways view of the kitchen. The decor of the restaurant is dark, modern and cozy. Tables are near each other but not too close as to be uncomfortable.Our server was sweet, patient, and above all, knowledgeable... Offering her suggestions and favorite pairings.We ordered three appetizers: the Bloomy Rind cheese plate, the Brussels Sprouts and the Scrapple. Their cheese plate is now my new favorite in town (just get it), the Sprouts were sautéed in a brown, sweet sauce and the Scrapple was everything I remembered it being when I used to eat it as a kid... Only elevated to a classy level.We all had trouble deciding on entrees, but most of us ended up with the beef cheeks or the duck risotto. Not one bite was left on a plate. Not one!We got the last Apple cobbler of the night... So wrote the 30 minute wait.They offer a tasting menu, multiple courses with wine pairings. We saw a table next to us enjoying that... We'll be back for that in the not so distant future, it looked fabulous. I was legitimately sad to leave and can't wait to get back. Josephine is not to be missed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "YUM!!! My review is for their brunch, and it was very good. At 10:30am there were plenty of open spots for brunch, and we were excited to give this new restaurant a shot. I can see it becoming very busy once word spreads! I had a french press coffee and my BF had a latte (they have almond milk too!). We decided we needed something sweet to snack on with our coffee, so we had the pistachio and dried cherry sticky buns.... they were heavenly and plenty for two people. They came out in a cast iron skillet and wow... we ate all of them though we shouldn't have. By the time our food came out we were full. We enjoyed (in small bites) the fried oyster sandwich and I had the quiche subbed benton's bacon for fries. The quiche was awesome and the sandwich was great, but we could have used a tad bit more oyster a bit less bacon on the sandwich. But overall, it was so good. I've noticed in some other reviews that some people had pretentious waiters. I can see that a bit. My guy gave me some attitude that I wanted to sub out my fries for bacon, and when my boyfriend asked for fries he slightly snottily pointed out that \"the fries are exceptional\" and I felt like he was saying I was making a mistake in not getting their fries. Yes, they are good, but I'd rather have bacon! I really love the space and they had some mimosa selections that were tempting. I'm really excited to make a reservation for dinner so I can experience the full menu!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Had dinner with a group of 4 on a Thursday night. Restaurant was busy all night but service was great and attentive throughout the meal. One of us is a vegetarian and the restaurant had plenty of options to accommodate. We ordered the crispy pork belly, zucchini and squash and the buffalo cauliflower to start. Pork belly was delicious and tasted almost like a parmigiana dish. Buffalo cauliflower might've been my favorite dish of the night. Unique spin on cauliflower. Entrees were made up of monkfish, pork chop and hanger steak. Pork chop was cooked perfectly. Not too fatty but still tender and juicy. Ended the meal with the apple pie, which is highly recommended if you still have room! Tons of apples and wasn't overly sweet. Remember you need to order 30 minutes prior. Solid spot for dinner with great cocktails and consistent food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My scallops were so mediocre...room temp on a cold purée potato base.  I do not do meat & there were only 2 choices for me. Scallops or Monkfish. I wish all restaurants had a killer vegetarian entree... Just one! My b'friend had lamb with some pasta & he enjoyed it! Dessert... Yuk. Cream puff kinda sorta like tiramisu ... No Bueno!

    "comments": "Dumpling with rabbit and sage (small Plate) was fantastic!  Oh, those soft and perfectly pillow like dumplings, will linger in my mind for many months.  The brussel sprouts with peanut vinaigrette and dried cherries was also very good (Small Plate).  The 1/2 chicken main entree was tender, and juicy.  Did not have much seasoning, so it was not very exciting from a flavor perspective, yet still cooked perfectly.  Saving grace there.my server was friendly, but one thing that bummed me out was the attention of detail to the table adjacent to me.   Quite possibly she knew them? Whatever the case.  Their silverware was immediately replaced after their appetizers.  She was at their table religiously it seemed.  My one appetizer (unfinished) sat on my table during my entire dining experience.  The main course was brought to my table, yet I had not received replacement silverware.  After about 2 minutes of me finally making eye contact with my server, that was remedied.  Thankfully, the chicken dish was still quite hot. I could be way off base, however it was almost as if they may have been short staffed on servers.  I noticed three of them, for a pretty crowded dining area.  The angel food cake is ridiculous, and will whisper sweet songs in your ear, if you hold it close enough.  That dessert kicked major culinary ass.  a decent experience overall.  Wouldn't rush back, but would recommend to others, specifically for the dumplings and dessert.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was able to experience the new X|X (pronounced ten by ten) menu at Josephine this past weekend. They have this dinning experience on Fridays and Saturdays at 8pm. The table is limited to ten people. The ten by ten represents the ten people at the table and the ten courses you have. For the ten courses it's $85. You can also have their drink pairing with the meal for an extra $35. I know what you're thinking, 120 bucks for dinner and drinks? Well, after I had it, it's WELL WORTH IT. This was my first time at Josephine. We arrived a quarter till 8 on a Saturday. We hunted for a spot and then we remembered they had FREE valet. The restaurant has a basic setup, a large bar in the middle, with dinning areas on the left and right, the bathrooms on the left and the X|X table to the right, right next to the kitchen which is partly opened to the restaurant. They also have a patio area off to the right side of the restaurant as well. All ten people sit at one large, rectangle table. Remember to say hello to your neighbors!Before the meal starts, Chef Little comes out & talks a little about the concept & how that the menu can change from week to week because they use what is available from the local markets & what is in season. He also come out during the different courses to explain why the paired certain flavors with each other. Pastry Chef Kayla May also narrates her different wonderful creations & service director Karen Little goes over the different drink pairings they have with the courses. They pair 6 different drinks with the ten courses, we started with a beautiful rosé, then moved to a Sauvignon blanc, a beer, a Chardonnay, a Merlot & finishing with their house coffee with some Four Roses bourbon & cream inside. So delicious. The food. With then courses, you best come hungry. The portions are perfectly sized for you to enjoy the food. They don't have to shovel a bunch on the plate. The food has such a great flavor & complexity that you're just enjoying it. I really wished I'd wrote some notes during the dinner, but I'll try my best from member & pictures. Each course has a one word name to give a hint at what was to come. The first course was called \"Snacks\", it consisted of homemade kettle chips with a whipped butter dip, a radish with a house made dip & a scallop. The whole thing came out on a 2x8 high glossed piece of wood. They used this a couple times throughout the service. It was pretty neat I thought. Next was \"Asparagus\" which was asparagus with prosciutto, caviar, whipped butter, something a little crunchy on the side & an edible flower. Next was one of my favorite courses, \"Kale\". The kale course had, of course kale, on the kale was shaved beef heart. Chef Little even joked that he thought he might have us try it before he told us what it was. I never thought I'd ever eat beef heart but it was so delectable. The thin cut of it was perfect. After the heart came course number four, \"Pretzel\", a hand twisted pretzel served on the large board with a dipping cream. Number five was called \"\"Spring\"\", it was a ravioli covered in a brightly colored yellow sauce, & the most interesting mushrooms I've ever seen. At the halfway point we have \"Swordfish\". A nice piece of grilled swordfish with peas & beans. Next we have \"Short Ribs\" which were three, nice thick pieces of short ribs cooked to perfection. The right about of char on the outside of the meat. The last 3 courses were dessert courses. We had the \"Goat Milk\" which was goat's milk panna cotta with strawberries. So fresh & palate cleansing. Next we had the \"Goo Goo\" which was a deconstructed Goo Goo Cluster. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate & I loved it. Lastly we had the \"Candies\" which included two sugared gel candies, one strawberry & the other I think peach. A dark chocolate candy which I took a small bite & was too chocolatey for me, & an espresso cream filled craquelin puff. They even gave little bags to take the treats home with you if you didn't have room! I really cannot wait to go back & try something off their brunch or dinner menu.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

But until I'm no longer single, I'll continue to go with my girlfriends :) We went there for brunch, and we started with apple cider donuts holes. Yum! They were tasty and fresh. I ordered the omelet with sauteed veggies with fries and a side salad, and I immediately regretted my decision as soon as the waitress all brought out my friend's cheeseburger. My friend enjoyed it. The omelet was okay and nothing more. Overall I enjoyed the experience, but Josephine didn't have that wow-factor that a lot of Nashville restaurants have. I would give them a 3.5, but I'll round up since I've only been there for one meal and will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Late review, started in June...The wife and I finally decided to visit Josephine last minute (8:45pm) Friday night without advance reservations.  My biggest regret was that we haven't visited sooner!  Pleasant ambience, dimly lit, not too noisy but not too quiet.  Service was attentive but not too helpful in wine recommendation.  I understand that drinking red with swordfish is abnormal but that was the craving.  That being said, the food was very good and portions were substantial but taste was just shy of greatness.  Breakdown of meal:Wine was good and well priced, small selection but manageable.Apps were the Pretzel bread, buffalo cauliflower, and the squash/zucchini salad.  The salad was a standout item, excellent in taste and presentation.  The bread presentation was very pretty as well, taste was............ a soft pretzel.  Buffalo cauliflower was also good but a bit too salty, more appropriate flavor of bar food snacking (not necessarily a bad thing).  All portions generous in size.Entrées were the Spaetzle for myself, the swordfish for the wife.   Maybe being that I am from San Diego, I was not impressed with the swordfish flavor.  I feel it was prepared a bit overcharred and bland on flavor.  The pairings of asparagus and the puree lacked any contribution to the dish.  With that being said, she was happy with the dish.  The spaetzle was far superior to any that I had experienced in many different parts of Germany.  Maybe not traditional with the addition of some bacon and spices, but delicious.Dessert consist of the Apricot vacherin and the chocolate napoleon.  The Apricot vacherin blew me away, and I am a total dessert fanatic that typically goes for rich chocolate dishes over fruit flavors.  Conclusion, I will definitely be back and would not hesitate to order the Apricot vacherin and the zucchini salad again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The service was top notch. Attentive but not bothersome. They have created an unpretentious but elegant dining experience. The clientele was as eclectic as the area.I hate cauliflower but if my momma had served it grilled and tossed in buffalo sauce I would have had it twice a day! Add to that some exquisitely seasoned Brussel sprouts and you have two appetizers you can feel good about eating. The beef cheeks were awesome, the sauce/gravy was rich but not salty. The steak was perfectly cooked but would have preferred it to be served whole as opposed to sliced. That being said, the steak was delightful.The meal was topped off with a hot pecan pie served with coffee ice cream. It was so well balanced and exceptionally prepared that it should be a crime to serve it any other way!In just one visit I am a fan! I liked it so much that if we were going to have more children and we had a girl I would name her Josephine!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The hostess let us know that there was basically a waiting-list for the wait list.  She told us that our best bet was to find a seat at the bar or try another place.  Luckily, a couple of seats opened up at the bar in less than 5 minutes.It took a while for someone to take our drink order, but the place was slammed. We ordered the brussels, kale salad, and chicken wings.  The food came out super quick and was delicious. The brussels were our favorite with a peanut sauce and chopped peanut crumble on top.  Normally, I am not a fan of brussels that are so soft and cooked through, but they were delicious.Great first stop in Nashville for a quick bite and drinks.  Fun atmosphere and good people watching!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Our first trip to Nashville and we had the joy of eating at Josephine.  Their location was great and had a very lively vibe.  The drinks were great(wife had the Mezcal Mule and I had a local IPA) as we got there early and ordered some at the bar then were quickly shown to our table when it was ready.  The service was supreme.  We got several appetizers to try and were not disappointed by a single one.  The brussel sprout app was fantastic as was the Scrapple(a more Pennsylvania dish hearkening to the chefs prior position) with a distinctly Nashville hot twist.  We also enjoyed the chicken skins and hummus app as well as the pretzel bread/mustard. This gave a great starter to some amazing entrees. I got the beef cheek(very tender and flavorful with great side root veggie pairing) and my wife had the duck(paired with corn and squash) and we shared a taste - both were awesome.   The attention to detail in the decor and menus(hardwood planks with menu inserts) made the restaurant have a unique feel to it.  For dessert we sampled the bananas foster cake, the chocolate panna cotta and the Pistachio cake.  I would typically not have ordered the pistachio cake but found it to be my favorite of the desserts by far.  It has a phyllo dough layering that paired well with all of the ingredients.  The panna cotta was a close second with the bergamot flavor from the Earl Grey tea perfectly complementing and enhancing the chocolate.If you're looking for fine dining in the Music City look no further and book a reservation to Josephine on 12th.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was served with grilled asparagus and crab meat. The hollandaise sauce had great flavor but did not over power the taste of the fish. Also had beef tongue which I've never tried before. Very tender and good taste as well. It basically tasted like a very tender price of pot roast. I think if they would change the name to slow roasted beef everyone would get it. It was tough getting past knowing what you're eating and the table next to us said the same thing. I do recommend it though.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The food was delicious at Josephine.  The pretzel bread melted in our mouths.  We both had the salad with watermelon and frisse and had to contain ourselves from licking our bowls.  The entrees were excellent---tuna and duck in our case.   We actually returned for brunch where we devoured a delectable peach tartine --- could not have been more peachy! Speaking of peaches, do order the peach cobbler.   The presentation was delightful---a little cast iron skillet accompanied by a miniature ice cream carton.   And it was scrumptious. So why three stars?   Excruciatingly slow service--molasses going up hill in January slow.   At dinner we thought it was because we ordered piecemeal, so at breakfast we ordered everything at once. This made no difference. And mind you we were just a party of two.   The time between courses seemed like a lifetime.  When our second courses arrived, we were starving all over again.  Perhaps this was our server ( an older gentleman in glasses), but it is a major negative.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Those donuts?  Crazy good.  The cheeses?  Three unique cheeses along with toast (you will probably need to order some additional) and nuts to crunch on.  Perfect!  One in our group also had the yogurt and granola which was a large portion and also delicious.Our bartender was Asher and he was great!  Attentive and quick to refill this tired girls coffee cup.And whatever the soap that they use in the bathrooms was, I wanted to put it in my purse as I loved the scent!Next time you find yourself on 12th Ave south looking for a little respite from the nearby shopping, stop in.  You'll be glad you did!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Thus, you cannot depend on having a \"favorite\" dish always available.  Atmosphere on Sunday night was great.

This time, I decided to try it out again since it had been so long. There were parts of the meal that tasted great and some parts not so much. For appetizers, I ordered the frisée salad and the chestnut ravioli with mushrooms. Both had great flavors and it made me excited for the entrees. When the dishes came, I was less than impressed. I ordered the steak and frites (weary bc last time I ordered the steak it was bloody and tough) and sadly, not much has changed with this dish. Once again, the steak was tough and chewy. The flavor was there but I couldn't get past the texture of the meat.  It tasted like it needed to rest longer before slicing it into odd, uneven size portions. I would definitely suggest not ordering this. Another suggestion would be the scallop dish, although I wanted a pinch more salt on it. Overall, the service was good, the apps were satisfying but the entrees fell flat to me. I would say our meal was pretty average.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Reservations are available, the atmosphere is relaxed with a low key vibe (not stuffy at all), and valet is available for the crazy busy 12th south area. Also. The food is fantastic.My friend and I split the maple pecan sticky buns and that was probably the best decision of my day. I got the omelet that had mushrooms/peppers/onions which comes with a salad and fries (which are fried in duck fat. duck fat fries. Which obviously translates to being fantastic) and my friend got the quiche that also came with a salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. We debated on ordering with the waffle (I drooled a little as it was brought to the table next to us) but since we got the sticky buns as an appetizer, we decided on a protein option for our entrée. So needless to say, I wanted all the food things. Our server was attentive and the food was delicious and not too overpriced.

    "comments": "Our experience at Josephine was nothing short of stellar.  From the friendly front house manager who took our reservation and was helpful, friendly and accommodating, to the hostess, to the incredible wait staff who were friendly, welcoming and responsive, to the people preparing the food, and the head chef himself, it was all just perfect, start to finish.  For starters, our party shared the pretzel bread with housemate mustard, the crispy chicken skin with black-eyed peas hummus, the Nashville hot scrapple, and the amazing roasted Brussels sprouts with dried cherries, orange, peanut vinaigrette and rye crumb.  All four were delights to the palate, and you could definitely see chef Andrew putting a Nashville touch on his Pennsylvania \"eat like you live here\" inspired cooking.  For my entree I had the Duck Breast with dried cherries, toasted corn, arugula and butternut squash.  My husband had the beef cheeks with glazed root vegetables, potatoes and bacon.  We tried a little of each others dishes, and both were phenomenal.  Everything was balanced and all the flavors paired together so nicely.  The medium rare cook on the duck with the perfectly done crispy skin was particularly wonderful.For dessert our party shared the chocolate panna cotta with Early Gray, strawberry and chocolate cookie crumble, the Pistachio cake with honey and rose buttercream, phyllo and blood orange sorbet (cranberry is currently listed on the menu, but I think it might have been blood orange that night), and then we rounded it off with the Bananas Foster inspired layer cake.  All three desserts were amazing and delightful, but special mention goes to the panna cotta for the inspired pairing of the chocolate and Earl Gray.  The bergamot notes of the Earl Gray just paired so beautifully with the richness of the chocolate.  The other big surprise was the pistachio cake. It was just a carnival of flavors with the saltines of the pistachio, the richness of the buttercream (really rich and decadent), and the sweetness of the honey and spices, along with the light crunch of the phyllo layers.  Almost like a slightly deconstructed baklava. And the addition of the small dollop of sorbet leant just the right touch of fruit and tang to the dish.  We left not only full, but with happy, happy palates and definitely plan on coming back again next time we're in town.  Cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I hate writing negative reviews especially about restaurants in Nashville because I think the food scene here is just fabulous! It took over an hour for us to get our food once we ordered. They brought our appetizer after 30 minutes and my plate was dirty with crusted food. They were not able to make dietary accommodations with peanuts in the kitchen. After an hour when our food finally came it was made incorrectly. Ended up going to brunch and had nothing to eat. They \"took care of the omelet\" which was made incorrectly but it didn't take care of the experience and my appetite. With a restaurant this expensive I would at least expect quality service.  I've been here for happy hour before and it was awesome but I have to say the brunch was quite the disappointment.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've never been so torn between two emotions over one visit to a restaurant.First impression was terrible.  We had dinner reservations at 7:30 on a rainy Saturday evening.  We arrived about 5 minutes early, and when we walked in, their was no where to stand.  The bar was packed, and their wasn't near enough space in the foyer.  Our table was ready and we were seated on time, but navigating our way through the crowd was quite difficult.We were greeted by our waiter with a smile and menu almost immediately.  We had planned to order cocktails, then place our dinner order when the cocktails arrived.  It was about 10 minutes til we saw our waiter again, and by that time we were ready to order.  The timing of our meal was thrown off because our cocktails and apps arrived at the same time, and our entrees followed closely behind.My wife had the bibb lettuce salad app and the scallop entree.  The salad was simple...bibb lettuce and buttermilk dressing. Nothing to say.  She loved the scallops, which I cannot comment on because I personally loathe scallops.  Overall, she was very happy with her meal.I had the rabbit dumpling app, and the beef cheek entree.  The rabbit dumplings were delicious.  Perhaps the sauce was a little sweeter than I expected, but still an outstanding dish.  I would've been happy with an entree size portion.  The beef cheeks are highly regarded through other reviews.  Honestly, I didn't love them.  They were well prepared, spoon tender and moist.  However, they just missed on flavor.  Braised beef is one of my favorite things on the planet, and I've had better.In total, the delay at the beginning of service threw off the timing of our meal.  We wanted to order cocktails, and place our orders when our cocktails arrived.  Instead, we ordered everything at once, and felt as if we were somewhat rushed out of the door, despite being delayed early.As I said, I'm torn is this review.  The first impression wasn't great.  In general, the food was great but the portions were a bit small. The service was hit or miss...slow at the beginning, expedient in the middle, and rushed at the end.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Josephine came recommended by a family friend who's been living in Nashville for some time.  It was at the top of his list; I believe he recommended dinner but I could only make brunch.  We ordered the sticky buns for the table - definitely a highlight!  Really anything served in a hot iron pan has to be delish, right?From there, I have to say I was less than inspired.  I ordered the omelette which can be served \"with caramelized onions, peppers or mushrooms\".  I chose the caramelized onions which were not caramelized.  They were lightly steamed but not showing signs of any kind of browning.  The eggs were fluffy, there was cheese throughout but otherwise the dish itself was kind of boring.  The onions did little to enhance the experience.Everyone else seemed to be ok with their food.  No one was blown away.  Ambiance was a little stuffy for my liking but nice, classy.  The server was professional but not that engaging. Overall...didn't live up to the hype unfortunately.  Our group stopped at Flipside beforehand and that was much more our speed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Each dish was cooked to perfection, with each meat falling off of the bones, and the mustard dumplings just melting in your mouth. Next,for our main course, we ordered the monkfish and the quail. I was not crazy about the monkfish although it was flavorful. The quail however was delicious.  And last but definitely not least dessert!  The cheesecake is to DIE for. My only complaint is that the portion is waaaaaay to small for $8. But will i buy it again?...Yes! Although this place is pricey, you will leave feeling satisfied (if you get 3 courses).

    "comments": "Easily the best meal I have had in Nashville. The interior (and patio) are gorgeous. Just the right amount of an industrial look. The atmosphere is a dressy casual.  We had a group of 5, including 2 children (10 and 13). We were shown to our table right away and no one seemed to blink an eye that there were kids in an obviously grown up environment (with menu to match). I couldn't remember all of the food we had, as we ordered a good bit. That is one of my pet peeves there, it seems most everything is a la carte. The stand out starter for us was the escargot in parsley. Very well cooked and everyone at the table liked it. For 3 of our 5 entrees we had the steak and fries. The kids and I are connoisseurs of a great piece of steak and tasty potato. Our steaks were cooked perfectly, two medium and one medium rare. The seasoning was on point and we gobbled it up. The French fries were the best we had ever had and our table couldn't stop saying that. We also shared some veggie sides which were all great. The service was on point and didn't hover, which I enjoy, but was there when we needed anything. The only downside other than the a la carte business was the overflow from the ice cream place next door. I know they can't help that, but we constantly got distracted people watching the loooooooong line coming out of jeni's.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Let me start off by saying that I wanted to give this place 1 star, but I feel as though I need to give 2 stars for the way that the manager handled our very odd dining experience. She did genuinely seem to care about our experience, but it was all too far gone at that point. Of the group I was with, we all regularly eat out at nice restaurants, and one of us is affiliated with a popular, upscale restaurant in another city. Plus, we really wanted to love this place since we had friends who ate here 2 weeks before (also in the hospitality industry with very discerning standards) who said it was great.The meal started promisingly enough. We ordered cocktails and then put in a number of starters and an entree to split between the table. The server asked if that was all of the food that we wanted, and we asked if what we ordered was enough for the table for dinner or if we should order more (perfect opportunity to up sell). The server said no, so we didn't add anything to the order.The first grouping of appetizers that came out were good and included the brussels sprouts, which turned out to be our favorite food or the evening. I love brussels sprouts, but when that's the best item, something is wrong. This round of appetizers included all of the veges we ordered, so we knew the meat would be coming after. When we were done with the first round, our smaller share plates were cleared away and we were given larger share plates in anticipation of the meat.This is where it got weird. No more food comes out for what seemed to be 45 minutes, and the server seemed to be avoiding our table? Like she seemed to be going out of her way to avoid us. Did she want to avoid questions about where our food was? Was she angry at us for not ordering enough food? Remember that we asked her if we needed to order more for the table and she said no. We assumed she was pissed at us for some odd reason, which we cannot fathom. We had to flag her down to order another cocktail and ask about the status of the rest of the food, which she said would be out in just a minute.Finally, the rest of the food comes and is brought out by the manager, who was apologetic and unprompted said that dessert was on the house because it took so long to get the rest of our food. How was the rest of the food? Not good. Not only was it not good, but most of it was cold, so it had obviously been sitting for a while before it was brought to us. A few very sad items in this grouping: the risotto, which was ice cold; the spaetzel, say over salted; and last but not least, the pork belly, which was supposed to be \"crispy\" but there was nothing crispy about it - it was more like an odd thing pork loin with melted mozzarella cheese on top. Very disappointing.After this experience, we didn't even want to brave dessert and so just asked for the check, which was not adjusted at all for the wait for our food. We asked our server about that and the manager did end up taking a chunk of the bill, though for us it was more about the principle that the money, and also said she arranged for us to have a free round at another establishment to make up for our bad experience.On an optimistic note, everyone else dining there seemed to be very happy. Also, we had some excellent nachos next door after and stumbled upon a really cute little restaurant/bar with swing dancing across the street.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

He was attentive, well knowledge with the food and drink menus, and also very personable. The food: started with the brussels sprouts (AMAZING!) and the Spaetzel (different and really good). I had the steak as my entree and unfortunately it was over cooked (well done). This was my only complaniet and kind of a bummer. My friend had the lamb Pappardelle- which she loved. For Dessert we had the special: Pear Cobble which was divine. As for cocktails I had the Mr. October and the Chef's Special. Both were mixed very well and a perfect sipping cocktails. I'm glad we choose this place to be our \"fine dining\" while in Nash. I'd def come back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Good news first?  Okay:The ambiance is surely why this place is as busy as it it.  Beautiful lighting, layout, tables, everything down to the stemware is on fleek.The service was decent, I can't complain at all about timings of drinks or for which all was really smooth - I am more keen however on servers with more \"personality\" than ours last night.  I will say that she got our orders perfect and we didn't wait long for anything; she was nice, but that's about it.Now the bad news - and let me preface this by saying there were 5 of us there, and we all, unfortunately, shared the same opinions.  I've been to Josephine before and the food was much better.  The small plates were consistently good though: brussel sprouts were great as was the buffalo cauliflower.  The duck wings weren't good, the \"Bibb Lettuce\" salad was a $12 flop... I don't understand that price point on small plates of veggies.  We bought 7 apps including the pretzel bread (great but how can you mess up bread)... and were all anticipating the mains.  I tasted all of them:The steak was hanger.   Cooked to temp very nicely, but couldn't taste anything more than the layer of sea salt covering the steak.  Fries were fine....Risotto was good flavor, a bit heavy for me, which seems like covering lack of flavor with butter and cream - this was my dish, I ate half and left hungry.   The seafood we had was scallops and swordfish.  Both lacked flavor, and in my opinion any originality in the recipe.Drinks were good.  But for 5 people, a $320 meal (not including tip), I probably won't head back.  Just not worth the price for food I could beat in my own kitchen.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been here several times now; twice for dinner and twice for brunch. Each time, Josephine has absolutely slayed it. With the recent onslaught of celebrity chef-owned restaurants grabbing the spotlight in Nashville, I feel like Josephine has flown a bit under the radar. Maybe it has to do with the nondescript 12 South location. If you haven't heard about it, let me set the record straight; Josephine is one of the very best restaurants in Nashville.Quick positives: attentive/knowledgeable service, valet in a busy neighborhood, reservations via Open Table, French press coffee, and natural light.Now onto the food, because that's what really matters. Simply put, everything I've eaten has been delicious. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned, with attention to detail and flavors. The beef cheeks were nicely charred on the outside and fall apart tender; oh, and the sauce - wow. The scallops were maybe the best I've ever had. Perfectly seared and seasoned, they just melt in the middle. The rabbit and mustard dumpling small plate with ham, mushrooms, and apple cider reduction was insanely good. The buffalo cauliflower was roasted, slightly charred, and tossed in a traditional buffalo sauce with bleu cheese crumbles and shaved celery - a fun, healthier variation on something familiar. In the summer, their trio of melons was delicious and just beautiful to look at. Oyster po' boy, scrapple, fries, soups, salads. You name it, it's good.We also had one of the best desserts we've ever had here; a banana and bacon sticky bun topped with peanut butter ice cream, served in a small cast iron skillet. Are you serious? Speaking of the bacon, they make their own in house, and you won't want Benton's after trying this.Plating is beautiful and elegant, yet simple. Large white plates with negative space really draw your attention to the food in the middle. Forgot artisan spun, speckled  pottery here. The vibe is in the food itself. In the age of farm-to-fork, I feel like an increased emphasis on \"rustic\" has led to a decline in classic techniques. You'll see it all here (e.g. a perfect fine brunoise of raw chioggia beet topping the beef cheeks).My advice: don't change a thing, Josephine.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My boyfriend and I both ordered the eggs Benedict and for $13 a pop we assumed we'd be receiving enough food to fill us up. When the plates came to our table I was shocked. The eggs + bread were literally the size of silver dollars. Perhaps I missed the whole concept of this restaurant, but when I can go to literally any other brunch spot in the city & at that same price point, receive MUCH more food, I'm unsure why I would return. 2) Although I don't like to, we complained. The manager comp'd our meal, after she have us an explanation about the reasons their price points are higher- all local ingredients! I love supporting local farmers, but I know they up priced the heck out of that food. 3) I ordered 2 cups of regular coffee. They were about $3.50 each. Need I say more? Too expensive. I don't mind spending money, but with so many options in Nashville, I'm not likely to go back or recommend Josephine's.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Only complaint I had was a guest sitting next to us had so much perfume on it took away from the enjoyment of our dinner. Waiter noticed it too when I mentioned it.

The restaurant was not busy at all yet, but the very unpleasant hostess refused to seat us until our exact reservation time, even though the table was open. Once sat, we waited at least another 10 minutes before even being greeted by our waitress. Our waitress kept disappearing the entire time so if we needed anything, like a coffee refill or extra plate, we had to wait at least ten minutes each time for her to reemerge. Even getting the bill and paying took a long time. The food itself was pretty good, not five stars but maybe 3.5.

On my most recent visit, I found the server to be pretty ill-prepared for a vegan but once he spoke with the chef, a pretty good option was ultimately presented. I think it's pretty important for restaurants make sure there is a good vegan protein source available. I didn't get one but my meal was tasty. Also, I think it's important to make sure servers aren't hesitant to ask the chef about what dishes can be easily made vegan or if there is something easy he or she can do. I can't tell you how disappointing it is when I hear the server say, \"I know, why don't we do a plate of vegetables.\" It would have been nice to have a dessert option and better options for appetizers.

    "comments": "Our evening was PERFECT!  Be prepared to try something new and different. We had the gnocci (with rabbit and apple cider sauce) and pork belly to start, followed by the scallops with oxtail and beef cheeks, and homemade pear \"cobbler\" for dessert with walnut ice cream (it was really more of a pie made with fillo, but it was incredible!) Every course was perfectly balanced. Each flavor profile was delightful. Brian, our server, perfecty read us and timed our meal exactly to suit our tastes..He recommended the perfect wine for the small plates and entree's we ordered. Interestingly, it wasn't the most expensive wine on the list, but it was perfect with our meal It is a rare trait in a server. He wasn't trying to up his check average. He was trying to give us the best dining experience. He succeeded in spades!  My dining partner has eaten beef cheeks in the past, unlike me. He said they were the best he had ever tasted. Ever single course was absolutely perfect. It is expensive, but worth every, single penny!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So went to this place mostly by accident but was very pleasantly surprised.   I ordered the onion tart and beef heart sandwich with scrapple side. My wife got the pretzel french toast. First off the ambiance is awesome, modern with a touch of classic.The appetizer I had was the onion tart. I would highly suggest it. Some one else was complaining about it being buried under frieze lettuce. I think it actually adds a nice depth of flavor and keeps the onion tart from being an overwhelmingly rich bite.I had the beef heart sandwich with a side of scrapple. I would highly suggest both, the textures and flavors where delightful. The Beef heart was cooked to a texture that reminded me of almost a fresh sauteed mushroom. The scrapple had a perfect crispy outside with a smooth silky texture inside.My wife had the pretzel french toast. It was delicious. Great flavor and texture but it really could have used a little fruit on the plate. Something maybe sweet but slightly acidic to break up the sweet on sweet, and add a little color to the brown syrup on the brown pretzel french toast.All in all however, a great place and one I will be returning too.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was certainly tasty, but I think only because I added some sautéed vegetables to it. The Bloody Mary is also quite good. Perhaps the best I've had in this city, and also why I came back a 2nd time. However the beyond-rude bar staff will not have me coming back a 3rd.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The waitress forgot to turn in our order, which resulted in us waiting an hour and 15 minutes for our food. Upon getting our food (steak and eggs), the steak was very chewy and lacked flavor. When it came time to pay, I expected that AT LEAST one of the meals would be taken off the bill, but instead she didn't charge for our drinks (coffee and iced tea).  I understand mistakes happen, but at a nice Easter brunch with very few other tables, she should have provided better customer service. :(\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I spent the day at our corporate offices and we decided to try somewhere new for lunch and chose Josephine's as our destination.  I looove trying new places so I was excited!We got there and were immediately seated.  I believe we had a reservation, but it appeared you could also maybe swing some bar seating if you didn't have reservations.  We ordered up some of the soda bread with sorghum butter.  Nice little bites to tide you over until the entrees.For my entree I got the chicken with black eyed pea and endive salad dressed with an herb vinaigrette.  The chicken was cut off the bone so it wasn't difficult to eat.  It was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.  The black eyed pea salad was more difficult as it had red onions diced up all throughout and I really hate raw onions so I had to pick around them.  I tried a bite of the braised pork, provolone, and mustard sandwich and that was a great sandwich!  A little heavy but it seemed it would be worth the calories.  Fries were pretty good too and there were at least some that were super crispy which are my fave.Service was the only glitch.  Our waitress was a nice girl but it was a bit sloooow on the service.  Slow to take our orders and slow to get refills.  It may have been that she was new or that it was busy.  Not too bad but just a little bit too much time, especially for lunch.Overall an A-OK place.  The dinner menu looks really interested so I definitely want to go back at night and give it a whirl.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Food is better than it's competition, not overly salty or fatty as is the tired Bro chef trend, but dishes are unbalanced and could stand some tweaking. Sous vide/flash fried chicken for two was good, tender, no dried out breast; not sure 6-hour sous vide added much more than something to tout. Brussels sprouts bed under chicken needed a quick saute--raw was a disappointment. Salmon undercooked but otherwise good. Josephine (hanger) steak delicious but very small portion and the fries were fast-casual sloppy-not-hot-out-of-the fryer, more like the last of a bag of frozen fries tossed on a plate. Buffalo Cauliflower interesting idea, but limp and sparse. Over-sauced, overcooked. Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Peanut Vinaigrette is gummy and heavy-handed. Sprouts overcooked, mushy. Chocolate pot de creme interesting dessert-needs salt to balance sweetness. Lemon ice box pie crust rock hard, also needed salt to enhance pastry.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Admittedly I have wanted to come here for quite a while but life got in the way and I could not.  So when an old friend and I decided to catch up after a few years I snagged a table for two.Since 12 South can be so congested, I was immediately pleased that there was free valet.  That is always a perk in my book.My friend and I settled in at a corner table with a window view.  Granted, the most I could see were folks in line for Jeni's, but it is all good.  We perused the cocktail menu and made some decisions on the libations for the evening.  I decided upon an Eastsider - gin, lime, cucumber and mint....  But since I am allergic to juniper I had vodka substituted for the gin.  Loved it!  Refreshingly tasty - I'm sold.  My friend had a very buttery Chardonnay.  Our server was kind enough to walk her through the different chardonnays on the menu.Again, our server was fabulous at walking us through the food as well.  My friend and I decided upon sharing a couple of small plates and then splitting a main course.  Our dutiful server asked if she could space them out for us and we left that choice in her capable hands.We split the Bibb lettuce salad with bacon, croutons, radish and herb buttermilk dressing.  Although it was quite good I thought the $9 price tag was a bit outrageous for a salad.  We also split the chestnut ravioli with roasted mushrooms, sage and a butternut squash sauce.  Holy moly, was that delightful!  I could easily have ordered another small plate of that ravioli and called it a night.  It was decadent without being over the top.  It was rich but in a subtle way that simply made me yearn for more.  In other words, I loved it!  Our main course was the beef cheeks with celery root, kale, cornbread and horseradish.  As well prepared beef cheeks should be this was unctuous and melted in my mouth.  Again, I adored this dish and could easily have pierced my friend's hand with my fork to get more for myself.  But I am too kind for such shenanigans (ahem).  For dessert we settled upon a Nutella layer cake with candied hazelnut and orange peel.  It was indulgent but not overtly.  That and an Irish coffee ended a great evening.  The ambiance, the service, the food, all wonderful and was a great accompaniment to catching up with a dear friend.  But I also met a delightful new friend in Josephine and I will be back to see her again soon.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The pierogis seemed more like empanadas in my mind and the steak came with French fries. The tastes were all great so I guess i was just expecting more for the price. The server was fantastic and so was the ambiance. The second time was yesterday for brunch and we were served by Jackson who was fantastic!! It was a large group of us for a birthday with lots of drinks and crazy spastic ordering which he handled with a gracious smile. His wine presentation made up for my last trip but the food was still a bit lacking. Steak and eggs came with out eggs, the fried egg on the burger was over hard which I've never seen before but then again we didn't specify so maybe that was the way the chef recommends. The scrapple and bacon were fantastic and Jackson brought out donuts and cinnabuns for the birthday!  So Delish. Another cute addition was the personal French press coffee and everyone gets cookies at the end!  Although the food was less than expected we will all be back bc of Jackson, his attitude and the overall experience was amazing. Thanks for making the birthday great!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

One of the appetizer we had was the pierogies. Alright, I am half Polish and Half Ukrainian. I grew up eating more pierogies than probably anyone in Nashville. My Grandmother, my Aunts, my mother would be rolling over in there grave if we they even saw these. They would say WT# in today term. They need to change the name to Empanadas. The shrimp Appetizer was the best of the three we had. We had the Chicken, the Scallops and the Fish dish. The Chicken to me was disappointing and to dry. The scallops and Fish was good but again they were not special. Again we got 3 deserts and they were good, but nothing was outstanding. Sorry for the money we paid I just feel they didn't score a home run. Sorry.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was THRILLED for my party of four to be seated immediately on a Sunday at noon.The decor is on point- I love the wood backed menus, Le Creuset water pitchers and Edison bulb lighting.The Meyer lemon doughnuts were absolutely the star of the meal. They were even served warm and in a little tiny skillet. There were three to an order- great to share with the table.I ordered the quiche and wasn't totally blown away. It wasn't all that hot when served and I thought it was a little dry. The salad it came with and fries were delicious, however, so that made up for things. Also- I was pretty stuffed from my lemon filled deliciousness at the beginning of the meal.Service was great! I'm excited to give Josephine a try for dinner and drinks- the bar is beautiful and drink list impressive.

One great aspect about this restaurant is that you can make reservations for brunch on Saturday and Sunday which is hard to come by in Nashville. The interior is beautiful and modern, but still cozy. We went around 11am on Sunday morning and it wasn't overly crowded (started to fill up around 11:30-noon). Our server, Tina, was such a delight! We got the cherry/pistachio sticky buns to start (which were so yummy) and the quiche (delicious! amazing crust!) and the french toast. The entire meal was wonderful. I thought the prices were very fair, the portions excellent and overall it was an upscale brunch experience without costing a fortune. This is a great place to bring your girlfriends, but also appropriate for a date or meal with the parents. I will absolutely be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The dinner I had at Josephine a couple months ago knocked many a Nashville dinner OUT OF THE PARK.  It was unbelievably good from beginning to end. For appetizers, the tabled shared the Buffalo Cauliflower, the Pretzel Bread, and the Chestnut Agnolotti.  All were good, but there was something extra special about the agnolotti.  For dinner I had the beef cheeks, which were tender, fall-apart-in-your-mouth without seeming like a family member's crappy pot roast. (Not a family member of mine, mind you...)Josephine has got to be quick in offering dessert, as Jeni's is right next door.  Alas, we didn't do dessert there. (We went somewhere in the uh, neighborhood that rhymes with.. Denny's...) The sweets menu is short and reads a little unimpressively to me, but my guess is it's one of those things where the dessert menu reads simply, and the actual desserts are wonderful. A 100% recommendation from me: a wonderful choice for a special occasion or taking an out-of-towner somewhere local, special and fancy.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

While it's not going to take my top three or four spots I'm not putting it very far behind that.  Considering the immense competition and wealth of fine dining options these days I would regard that as an admirable feat. The first thing that impressed me was the service. Our waiter was always on the ball. It was quite surprising how prompt he was considering that the place was completely full. Even though the restaurant was busy everything arrived very quickly. I think our apps arrived before I even took my first drink.The real standout here though is the food - nearly every dish was exceptional. Even the dishes that were least impressive were still quite good. Chef Andrew Little's Pennsylvania Dutch influences really shine through on a lot of the dishes and it makes for a nice spin on things that you don't see at other restaurants around town. One example would be the Sticky Buns - a decadent concoction of bacon, banana, and peanut butter ice cream that left eyes rolling in the back of our heads. As far as drinks, the whiskey menu isn't anything special but was perfectly acceptable. The cocktail menu is solid though and is scattered with a few good classics. I had an Aviation that was excellent.Another impressive quality is that the price seems to be on the low side compared to other options around town. A night out for two was a solid $20 cheaper than a very similar dinner at another highly allocated fine dining location just one week before. Not only was the price cheaper but Josephine was significantly better.  As far as value goes it's a winner. All in all, Josephine has impeccable service, outstanding food, and prices that won't break the bank. It's a complete package and worthy of being included with the best restaurants this town has to offer.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The food was pretty solid, service was pretty good, cocktails were delicious. The style is very trendy, and looks like the Pinterest board belonging to Garden and Gun. Lots of things bound in leathers, gingham, and Sperry shoes. I like Garden and Gun, so it looks good. Albeit maybe a bit dated (as in, give it a few years and it's going to be sooooooo very 2013). The food is good! Nothing to write home about but very solid and I feel that it was a good value. We got the steak to share (along with another entree) and it was local, a nice sized cut, and melt-in your-mouth-- all for $25. Our tab came to $90 for drinks, entrees, and an appetizer and I felt that to be really fair, if not a little on the very-good-value side, so that's nice. You should check this place out!

    "comments": "Your new favorite brunch spot? Sorry, probably not.I was so jazzed this morning when I saw that I could make brunch reservations!  It was such a thrill thinking I could, for once, enjoy a scrumptious brunch without a super-long wait on some East Nashville sidewalk.  However, when I arrived at Josephine I noticed that I didn't even need a reservation---it was prime time, but the place was half-empty. Of course, now I can see why.I do have so say the location was lovely and our server was friendly.  I ordered the omelette, the husband ordered the eggs benedict, and our friend had the burger.  My omelette was certainly not among the best I have ever had.  The burger was also nothing to write home about.  But, the eggs benedict?  It was comical. I seriously laughed out loud when my 6'6\" husband was presented with the most petite plate of breakfast I had ever seen in my life.  I'm not certain the dish could fill up a five year old!  It was totally ridiculous.  Basically, nothing about this place blew my skirt up.  Small portions, slightly big prices, and a whole lotta mediocrity.  I don't think I'll go back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our server explained that the scrapple was nothing like the stuff found in Pennsylvania and vicinity - glad that she did, because it was great. Brussels sprouts were also a big highlight. Everything was tasty though maybe too much smokiness to the carrots. Nice setting, comfortable atmosphere, very friendly server.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Enjoyed Sunday brunch in our first visit to Josephine.  Atmosphere is excellent and comfortable.  Food options are good and everything was well prepared. Service was attentive.  As a starter beverage, selected the grapefruit mimosa at $9. Drink taste was good with light grapefruit taste.  But didn't order a second one because the size was small for the price/taste.  We shared the chery/pistachio sticky bun as a starter. Yum, yum.  We all ordered breakfast items.  The steak and eggs was $24.  The hangar steak came with 8 small slices which was a disappointment for the price.  The eggs benedict selection was some of the best ever tasted.  Highly recommend this option.  The spinach goat cheese quiche was a bit dry but had decent flavor.  Not sure that french fries is the best side item for the quiche.Overall, food was tasty and well prepared, but prices were high for size of portions and type of food.  This may keep me from coming back for brunch.Will try dinner sometime.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Date night here with my husband a few weeks ago. Fabulous server and the ambience was very trendy and chic. Very much fits in with 12th South vibe! Ordered cocktails first round and wasn't impressed at all. $12 and tasted okay. My husband's wasn't strong at all. Ordered cheese platter and it was terrible. $14. Again, not good at all. Had to ask the server for a steak knife to cut the cheese (ha!) it was so hard. Again, not impressed. Second round was the carrots. Oh my! Now we are getting somewhere! Delicious. Carrots that are smoky with granola. Sounds  gross but it is a party in your mouth!!Next round was beet salad. Okay but not the best thing ever. Fettuccini was delicious but very pricey for a small bowl of noodles. Scallops were good but small and you get 3 for $20. Don't get the hype quit honestly. Food was good, but crazy expensive. New York crazy. And ps- we still live in Nashville.  Thankfully, my husband's employees gave him a gift certificate for $100 for his birthday...our bill was well over $120 plus tip after the gift certificate was taken off. $220 is a pricey dinner! Cannot say I would go back. Sorry ;((( Now Urban Grub,  Taqueria Del Sol, Edly's, Jenis Ice Cream.....all delicious!!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The cocktail menu was creative and diverse and Delicious (capital D!).2. The pretzel bread and small plates were great.3. Definitely try the butternut squash agnolotti- a great fall flavor and so fresh!  It was my favorite item on the menu.4. Great service (slowly making up for strike one!)The bad/ok:1.

I tried something a little different and went with the fettuccine with minced lamb, wow! The presentation was spectacular and the taste was the same.

    "comments": "I have to admit, previous reviews had me a little skeptical about dining here, but I'm so glad we did. My boyfriend and I came for dinner last night and plan on coming back as soon as we can. While the menu is set up as a 4 course \"tasting,\" our server explained right out the gate that this wasn't necessary or expected. This was his only helpful comment all night, but more on him in a bit. We skipped the bites, nothing seemed too exciting ($12 for a bite, no thank you), and ordered the carrots and the brussel sprouts. They were out of this world. I have never been so blown away by 2 plates of vegetables, and that's coming from someone who doesn't eat meat. The carrots had such an incredible smoky flavor and the dill sauce was fantastic. It's difficult to say anything about the brussel sprouts besides order them, and order them now. Order a second plate to take home. They're phenomenal ok?We also ordered and split the wild mushroom dumplings and the grouper. Both were good, but I have to say, the veggies shined. Who would have thought! Finished the meal with the German chocolate donuts, and while I am not a fan of coconut, these were fantastic. As a side note, the table next to us had the beef cheek and risotto, and I may start eating red meat again just from looking at that dish. Previous reviews complained about tiny portions which had me worried because I'm someone who isn't happy until I'm cursing myself for eating so much, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I was very full from what we had, and we split everything. The atmosphere was very cozy, yet chic, and while is was a bit loud sometimes, I didn't mind because it meant we couldn't hear the conversations at the tables directly next to us. Very warm and inviting. I could have stayed all night. Now this would have been a perfect evening had it not been for our waiter. He didn't introduce himself or crack one single smile. He spoke maybe 20 words to us the entire night and seemed to genuinely detest being there. Was someone holding a gun to his head in the back of house? Maybe. Our menus were snatched away the second we finished ordering, as well as our plates the second we took our last bites. I am hoping he was having a terrible night, because if not, that kind of service is inexcusable, regardless the restaurant. No better way to describe him than stone cold. Horrible service aside, we were so impressed with the flavors that we'd gladly come back. Especially to eat our way through the rest of the veggies.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The food wasn't bad. I've had better in Nashville, but it was good. I took my girlfriend here and we ordered the pretzel roll appetizer, the hazelnut angolotti, and the scallops. The only problem I had with the food we ordered was that my entree, the angolotti, was TINY. It belongs on the appetizer list, not under the pasta plates. The real problem I had with this place was the service we received. After seating us, our waitress immediately took away our wine glasses and wrote us off as underage. The service only got worse from there. Our waters were empty nearly the entire meal. Our waitress seemed to ignore us completely as she visited all the tables around us multiple times. When our food came out, the waitress turned to me and said what I ordered really isn't considered an entree and asked if I wanted to order anything else. Why she didn't warn me ahead of time is beyond me. I'm a college student on a budget and unfortunately couldn't afford to order another meal. We finished our meals relatively fast and spent the following 20 minutes watching our waitress visit every table around us multiple times while we sat with empty waters and empty plates. She finally came back and I requested the bill. When she brought it out she lurked a few feet from our table and waited for me to sign it. I honestly didn't feel like leaving a tip at all, but it felt awkward with her watching directly behind me. I filled out the bill and left. Before I even reached the door she was already walking back with the bill, which made me uncomfortable considering I only tipped 10%. tl;dr Don't go here if you're young. They'll write you off.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Similar to the consistency of short ribs but more flavorful and basically melt in your mouth. Not fatty at all, just very tender. I also had a tequila drink of theirs which was very good - I opted to have it over ice. Two others at the table got the steak and fries and said it was one of the best steaks they'd ever had. For appetizers we got the beef tongue (noticing a trend?) pretzel rolls, clams casino, and the cheese plate. All were very good - the beef tongue was amazing. The cheese plate, while relatively small, was noticeably interesting (read: delicious). I feel like typically by the end of the meal this would be the appetizer you forget about but it was not so here - they had some very interesting cheeses I had never had anything like before, the coffee grounds encrusted cheese being my favorite.OH and I almost forgot, probably the best brussel sprouts I have ever had were here. It was as though they had injected each one individually with the dressing they were served in.

    "comments": "When I first heard about this place, two things bothered me.The first thing that worried me was that the project was being headed up by the same folks that run Burger Up, an  establishment I find to be at best, mediocre.The second thing that bothered me was that the restaurant was labeled by the owner as \"Not fussy\".  What the hell does that mean?  Were you trying to say \"Not pretentious\"?  I can imagine a diner being \"fussy\".  I can imagine a shitty waiter being \"fussy\".  I can't imagine an entire restaurant being \"fussy\".  That's just stupid.But any concerns I may have had were immediately assuaged when I found out that Jedi Badass Chef Andrew Little (that's really his full name) was heading the project.  And any other hesitations were allayed once I ate there.The man is a got-damn visionary.  And he believes in scrapple.  And you had better believe that if this guy has free reign to do what he needs to do, that this is going to be one of the most talked about new restaurants in town, because some special things are happening here.When I arrived, my friends were already there and polishing off the cheese plate.   I can't authoritatively say what was on the plate, but what remained was a cheese rolled in coffee and a blue cheese that was divine.  Cocktails were the order of the day and for my first I tried the barrel-aged Negroni.  Tasty, and it helped to whet my appetite for more food.The chef intends you to try four courses, a Bite, a Vegetable, a Noodle or Dumpling, and a Meat or Fish.  We were told that they were \"European Portion Sizes\", which is true, if you are referring to the European countries where people are made out of chocolate, like Germany.  All joking aside, the pricing on the portions is great and you really get a nice sampling.  I also think that you could get away with ordering two or three courses, but hell, I'd hate to have to limit myself with all of the choices there are.Between the four of us, we ordered all of the bites.  Of all of them, it was a tough call to say what was best - I'd have to say that the beef tongue won the day.  It melted in your damn mouth.  Seriously.  It was like buttah, the liquid kind.   The Clams Casino were also excellent, and I was really wowed with  the texture and flavor of the pretzel rolls - so light and flaky.For the next round, we chose all of the veggies.  All of it.  And each potion was huge. Of this round, I can say that all of these are made for sharing, and I have to say that the grilled carrots were my favorite, probably followed by the cauliflower.  The carrots just had this amazing caramelized yumminess going on - plus all the way around.Next we faced dumplings and noodles.  Now, I must admit, this course was the one I was looking forward to the most.  This world needs more house-made carbohydrates.  And Chef Little aims to please.The right answer here was the Pork Belly spaetzle (and by the way the correct pronunciation is Shpate-zuhl), and holy hell was it good.  The pastrami-cured pork belly was just paired up so well with the sourdough spaetzle and I had a really hard time sharing.  The braised rabbit with the dumplings kind of threw me, because there was the tangy-sweet of the apple cider reduction, but it was still damn good.  And the hazelnut agnolotti was not only fantastic - I think it would have done really well as a dessert alternative.By this point in the game, my pants were a little bit more snug than the start of the game.  And frankly, I just didn't have it in me to do much more.  To be honest, I was bordering on \"B-word Fat\".  But I soldiered on, because this is AMERICA!I chose the beef cheeks because why not.  Perched atop a perfect bed of creamy risotto were perfectly-tender beef cheeks that just turned into beefy butter in my mouth.  And so many delicious meat juices...  A great portion size, too.  Some damn good comfort food.  The ladies had been told about some sort of secret chicken project, apparently there are only so many available a night, and sure enough, they were delivered a whole chicken (which could easily feed two or more) and veggies.  Tender, juicy; everything a chicken should be.Yes, I got sweets.  No, it was not a good idea by this point.  But I did it anyway.  I opted for the malted milk cake, which reminded me of a malty version of the pound cake my mamaw used to make; everything around it only enhanced the experience.  Coffee is served in a French press with a little hourglass to tell you how long to steep it.  Lastly, our server Carly did a fantastic job all night.There is no other place like this in town.  It is unique.  It isn't the same-old locally-sourced new spin on southern favorites horseshit that opens every other weekend.  We are damn lucky to have this place and it fits a niche that I didn't even know we were missing.  Bravo, you crazy bastards.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The ambiance of the restaurant is great and our waiter was polite and knowledgeable. The rest of the experience, however, was another story. Our drinks, although reasonably priced, were some of the worst cocktails I've had in a while and I was almost tempted to send mine back. We tried the cheese plate which was very mediocre at best. Much better cheese plate at Frothy Monkey across the street. We also tried the cauliflower plate which was good, but somewhat bland. For entrees, they were out of the chicken which was a disappointment, so we ordered the quail and the cod. The quail was flavorless and, although I would expect small portions from a place like this, the plate was tiny. The cod was a much worse experience. I know Nashville is not know for seafood, but this cod tasted fishy, was dry and rubbery and the kale salad was way too salty.To finish it off, how the heck do you feel comfortable offering Jeni's ice cream for $8 dollars when you can literally walk next door - literally 10 feet - to get the same for $4.50. I was looking forward to this experience but will probably not return\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I made the mistake of not making a reservation for Josephine, so note to self - make a reservation even on a weeknight. When we arrived without a reservation the hostesses acted like they had never been presented with an issue like this before. They fluttered around and whispered to each other for about 5 minutes while we just stood there.. so that was weird. Finally, when the situation (not sure what the situation was) was sorted out we were able to sit at a community table. I actually loved this part because the other patrons at the table were super friendly and welcoming, and gave us some great recommendations on what to order. Its fun that Josephine has an array of seating options from standard tables, to the bar, to community tables.. spices things up. Overall the food was really good. The vegetables, as other reviewers have mentioned, are a must. I was a disappointed in the carrots however because the smoky flavor was WAY overdone that they only tasted like smoke. The hazelnut pasta was not what I was expecting, but I suppose I should have done some more Yelp research and I would have known what I was getting into.. Very small and lightly sweet, not the best option for an entree. Our service was good, the atmosphere was fun, and I enjoyed the food. I gave four stars because I have had better meals in Nashville for around the same price. I think I had extremely high expectations and was slightly let down, but I'm sure I'll be back to give Josephine another go.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So my husband and I decided to go here on a date night since we had not been on a date in over 6 months. We are both chefs, so when we decide where to go for dinner, we take a lot into consideration. We had heard about Josephine and wanted to try it out. Lets just say we were floored. We have been to Etch, the Southern, Farmhouse, Flyte and Merchants. We know our way around Nashville fine dining. And let me say this beat them all. The drinks were good, nothing too extraordinary, but they are strong. You get your money's worth there. We had the Pocket Change (tasted like just straight vodka), the Sweetbriar (So good if you like watermelon) and the Chef's Special. This was a great way to start of the meal.For dinner we shared each course, and there was plenty of food for the both of us. We started with the Potato Bread with Browned Butter. The only compliant with that is that the butter is very hard to cut through. It comes out rock hard and you could hear a few dings every time we tried to cut that butter with our butter knives, but the flavor was spot on. For our vegetable course we had the Bibb lettuce salad. It was AWESOME. I kind of wish my husband would have disappeared for the time being so I could have polished that salad off alone, but I was considerate and shared. This was a TOP NOTCH salad. Then for our main course we had the Josephine Chicken. IT WAS AMAZING. If you go there and eat nothing but that chicken you will still walk out happy! Its not just a run of the mill chicken dish, it is chicken that has been sous-vied and then flash fried. It was by far the best chicken I have ever eaten in my entire life. I almost ordered steak, and I am so happy I didn't. We ate all we could of the chicken and took home the very small amount that was left and even the next day, cold out of the refrigerator I thought I could hear food angels as I ate the very little there was left. It came with a side of potato salad which was cold and totally a perfect pair with the chicken. We are both Pastry Chefs, so of course we had to try dessert. I had the Milk Chocolate Creme and my husband had the Lemon Meringue. Both were good, but not amazing. Then again after that chicken, nothing stands a chance. All and all, the best meal we have had in Nashville since we moved here 3 years ago. We will be back again, but the one problem now is that we may not be able to try the rest of the menu because the chicken is so extraordinary, I can't imagine ordering anything else.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

However, if I'm going to pay $15 + tax for dinner, when my food is brought out, my friends shouldn't have to ask if there is anything actually in the dish. They did ask because there was so little food they couldn't even see it.  It took me approximately 3 minutes to eat it. I was still hungry when I left. Also, when my friends arrived (before me) the server asked if they would like sparkling or distilled water to drink. They said sparkling. Oh, but she neglected to mention that you could get filtered tap water for free. Highly overrated. You're mostly paying for the pretentiousness. There are a ton of other restaurants in town that give you quality food, with good portion sizes, at the same price.  Probably won't go back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We have visited Josephine twice since its opening, and we are absolutely thrilled to have it in our neighborhood.  Josephine is a terrific complement to 12 South; it adds a fine dining presence to the growing menu of food and drink within walking distance.The atmosphere at Josephine is warm and welcoming; there is seating at communal tables, indoor tables, outdoor tables, and the bar.  On both our visits, we have been seated and served cheerfully and promptly.  The wait staff are attentive and knowledgeable.  We had cocktails both times, which we very much enjoyed (the blood orange mimosa at brunch was particularly tasty); we haven't yet delved into the wine list.  One small annoyance is that soft drinks are served without free refills; we were told that's because they come from bottles rather than a fountain, but we didn't notice any difference in taste or selection that would justify this quirk.The menu is French-inspired, but not overly long or obscure, and the food has been more than solid both visits.  On our first visit for dinner, we passed up every entree on the menu in order to enjoy a special of an entire roast chicken (more than enough for the two of us) on brussel sprout leaves.  The roast chicken was tender and flavorful, with the crispy skin adding just the right earthy touch.  On our second visit for brunch, we had a starter of sticky buns topped with pistachios and dried cherries; they were the stuff that sugary, starchy breakfast dreams are made of.  The eggs benedict came with a delicious light salad in a spicy vinaigrette that perfectly balanced the salty ham and eggs.  The secret star of the menu, though, is the burger; two smaller beef patties add up to just the right amount of meat, with a soft bun and a traditional set of toppings, all prepared to complete perfection and accompanied by irresistible house-made potato chips.  It's almost ironic that this may be a better bet for a burger than you-know-where down the street!  We ate so much brunch that we hardly had room for our dessert, a luxurious dark chocolate ganache and peanut butter concoction that would equal some of the best desserts we've had in Nashville.Fine food and superior service will likely make Josephine our new local hangout; we can't wait to go back for brunch or dinner.  If you live in the neighborhood, add this to your list of places worth your support.  Josephine is just what 12 South needed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "First off, reservations are a definite smart idea.  My friend and I met there at the bar at 5:30 and had a table reservation for 6.  I don't think they start seating people until 6 anyways.  By 6:30/6:45 the place was packed including the bar and stayed that way even as we were leaving at 8:30.  My friend described the vibe and decor as \"Restoration Hardware-ish\" and she really like it.  It is a trendy upscale place for sure.They don't have an expansive craft beer list, but they do have a respectable craft beer list.  From Terrapin Hopsecutioner and Moo-Hoo to Good People Pale Ale.There is valet parking, but if you are lucky like I was you can find a spot on the street.I will say that my experience at the table was more enjoyable than at the bar.  While there wasn't anything wrong with the bartender and he was friendly enough, there was also an aloof attitude there.  Although, I will say that I've been feeling like that a lot around town with the bartenders.  I think it is actually the vibe they are going for.  But again, he was friendly enough.Our waitress was very friendly and could read when we were talking in depth to not interrupt us.We started off with the Lobster Bread.  It was a $14 \"Bite\" and was 4 small toasts that had a bit of lobster on top.  This was probably the least enjoyable part of the meal.  Not that it was bad.  It was just an okay appetizer.  While I understand that the lobster is the reason behind the $14 price tag, I wouldn't order this again because I didn't feel it was worth the price.  If they could find a way to bring the price down to $10 then it's more of an appetizer price.My friend ordered the Brussel Sprouts from the \"Vegetable\" portion.  These. Were. Insane!  I would order these just for my entree if I go again.  And they are big reason behind the 3 stars.  Luckily my friend let me split these with her!For the entree, I ordered the Scallops and my friend ordered the Spaetzel.  The Scallops were $21.  For that price, you received 3 sizeable perfectly prepared scallops.  They were atop a small bed of roasted potatoes and mushrooms and small cubes of ham.  While I appreciated that the serving was a perfect size for one, $21 for 3 scallops is still a bit pricey.  Let me be clear that I don't mind pricey and I don't care to be served a ginormous plateful of food that I cannot eat.  But I think that if this dish were at $15-17, I'd be ordering this all day long.My friend enjoyed her spaetzel and pork belly and had enough to take leftovers home.  I'm not a fan of whole grain mustard and this dish is full of it.  So I did not have a taste of this.All in all, it was an enjoyable meal, but a lot of it was that I was able to catch up with a friend I had not seen in while.I think they are doing a lot of things right here and there is a lot of potential.  I would go back if the prices dropped a bit.  But it is a great spot in 12 South and they are lucky to have it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They were both good and the bartender was nice. It was a much more casual atmosphere than I expected, and noisy, especially with the prices being so high. There is an expectation that you will order all from all four sections of the menu; when our server informed us of such, and we said we probably wouldn't be doing that, she was clearly put-off and the attitude continued through the rest of the evening. However, we certainly ordered a ton of food so I hope she wasn't too disappointed.The food:3-stars: Clams casino, Leek tart (It was onion when we went), Cheese selection, Cauliflower, Chocolate Ganache Tart; nothing here was special or remarkable4-stars: Brussels Sprouts (although the presentation was lacking), Rabbit Dumpling, Sorghum Tart.5-stars: Braised Beef Cheeks. Holy moly those were out of this world!!Unfortunately, the beef cheeks aren't enough to keep me coming back. There are so many new, hot, high-end restaurants in town that the costs really do need to reflect the quality of the food, and for me, this was a miss. Not saying that I won't be back for a cocktail or two...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Definitely a good place to meet up for drinks and catch up with friends.Our food was seriously delicious from start to finish. I recommend the potato dumplings with rabbit & also roasted cauliflower. My friend loved her agnolotti as well. I'm not sure if they have a dedicated pastry chef or someone is just talented in that area, but those were my favorite bits of the evening. The pretzel bites were just perfect - I just had them yesterday, but am already craving them again!

I had literally just made my Christmas cards that featured my bunnies saying Hoppy Holidays before we went to dinner. I was so sickened to see that they serve rabbit here. I had to leave. I did show my waiter and the host my Christmas cards and they totally understood. I really wish they would reconsider that menu option. There are so many customers that live with house rabbits. It's  sad that so many restaurants are trying to push these dishes. And just so you know; a fryer (used for most dishes) is a two month old domesticated baby bunny. That's what you're eating!

    "comments": "The lady and I went to Josephine during its second week opened and enjoyed the experience immensely. We made reservations the first Friday that they started taking reservations so we did not have a problem getting in. I don't think everyone in the restaurant had reservations so I bet you can get a table as long as you don't go at peak time on a weekend night. That's just a guess though. The service at the restaurant was really quite good. She was able to describe every dish for the evening in detail on day 8 of their being open. I find that impressive as there was no hemming and hawing about she was new or they were new etc that I have experienced in the past. She just did a great job all around. As a starter we got the cauliflower because we wanted to compare it to the cauliflower at Etch. The cauliflower here had an interesting twist in that it was served with pepperoni, mushroom conserva, golden raisin, arugula, and walnuts.  It was really good and we enjoyed it. It still doesn't touch the truffled roasted cauliflower at Etch but it was the second best in the city behind Etch. Done very well. For entrees, I had the beef cheeks, horseradish risotto, rosemary and crumble, and she had scallops, fingerling potato, ham hock, mushroom, and Swiss chard.  She enjoyed her dish and I loved mine. I am a huge fan of horseradish and of risotto so the combination just hit the spot. And as far as beef cheeks go, don't be scared off. It is essentially the consistency of pot roast but seriously more succulent and delicious than a boring old pot roast. I really recommend that you branch out and have the beef cheeks. They are truly fantastic.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Just FYI...this is a review for BRUNCH. I haven't had dinner here yet, however I can't wait to try it.First things first, loved the way the space was constructed. Bar helps to split the dining room and the bar is a U shape which i like rather than a long one against the wall. It kinda says \"hey you can just cozy up to the bar and grab a drink too\". The old Parisian rug on in the dining room is a great touch, dark woods, one of the booths is a very cool dark maroon leather, very old world feel. So decor wise I think it's great! So for that I give it a 4. Things I learned from my visit :)1) You're brunch will not come with a side of anything, all that is extra2) Bloody Mary's are made with Pickle juice, which I find kinda odd and since I literally hate pickles and I desperately needed a bloody mary this didn't really work. When I asked if they could make it without the pickle juice, they said it was pre-made...I was hoping they could just whip me up one without since they have all the ingrediants, but they didn't. I think they should put \"pickle juice\" somewhere on the description since generally they aren't made with pickle juice.3) Don't be starving when you walk in -they must still be working out the kinks in services case we ordered a flat bread app (super easy and small portion) and we waited 30+ min for it! Then our main dishes came out right after...ummm that defeats the purpose of an app. So for speediness I give it a 3. However, for food I give it a solid 4 (again this is for brunch) Ok so yes, I didn't like the pickle juice in my bloody mary or the fact that it took waaaaaay to long to get our one flatbread app, but the eggs benedict I had was excellent, hollandaise sauce amazing and I love that they serve Benton's Bacon (we ordered as a side). My friends got fries with their brunch...and sadly the fries were burnt and not that great (which is strange since Burger Up's are so good) but the main point is the main dishes were great!! My friend got the omelet and she really enjoyed that and my guy friend got the steak which he said was really good as well. The flatbread app with caramelized onions, cheese and bacon was soooooo favorable and I\"m glad it was that good considering we waited forever, but I would get it again for sure!I give it an overall 4 since the food was really great and that is what I was hoping for. I can't wait to try dinner. They just need a few more weeks to get the kitchen up to speed I think. Also, services was really great as well. An added bonus :)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

If you're looking to find a place to have a great dinner and one or two drinks then this is the place for you.Service:We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. It was fairly early for the dinner rush but as we were leaving we noticed how packed the place was. Our waitress was extremely helpful and pleasant. She was very knowledgeable about the menu which was a plus since it was our first time there.Food:I had the Josephine steak and my girlfriend had the Mushroom dumplings (I believe). Both dishes were absolutely delicious. Pretzel rolls as an appetizer sounded fairly \"safe\" compared to the rest of the options but they were just as good as I imagine the others would be. The german chocolate donuts for dessert are an absolute must try. Drink wise - their wine menu was very nice. They have a cocktail menu as well however we didn't get an extensive look at it.Overall:Definite must try.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Everything was slightly off. Awesome space, but it was more than a little cold. Pork belly (yum) but cooked like chicken parm (odd). Beef cheeks with root veggies, and throw some raw apples on top. Everything was just a little off.  Bottom Line: seemed like they were just trying a bit too hard, like a PB&J with avacado.  Next time just make a really awesome PB&J. *note: this is not an actual menu item, just a hypothetical.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Was really glad that I was able to snag a reservation for this restaurant one week out considering how busy this weekend in nashville seems to be. A really nice manager at another high demand restaurant suggested Josephine and i am glad he did.Found this to be sophisticated but not overbearing. Lively atmosphere without being so loud that i couldn't hear the conversation at my own table. Even noticed acoustical touches in the ceiling.As for the food, overall pleased with the meal. Appetizer (ordered from the 'bites' section of the menu) were creative, beautifully presented and  delicious. For the adventurous, try the beef tongue. When i saw that it was grilled, i feared that it would be dry and overdone. Not the case. The protein was perfectly done and moist complemented by the creaminess of the corn puree below. Green tomato relish brought the right amount tart to the smokiness of the grillef meat . I also ordered the brussel sprouts as a next course which our waitress insisted was a one person portion. Actually, it could have served 3 especially as a side. Combo of dried cherries with the roasted sprouts went well. Peanut vinagrette was different. Would have liked to see a little less oil in the dish.I thought the portion of grouper that appeared on the entree (approx 1\"x4\") seemed skimpy for the price but in the end, i was too full to finish it. Fish cooked perfectly moist with crisp exterior, although a bit too salted for my taste (but i am taste sensitive too salt as i use very little in my own cooking).Dessert was really good, as shown in photo. And the individual french press coffee was a first for me and delicious.I will keep this one on my list and return on another Nashville visit\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's a sophisticated, successful, neighborhood restaurant. I wasn't aware that Nashville had sophisticated, neighborhood restaurants and am impressed at the progress made by the food scene here over the last several years. Josephine is not sophisticated like Mirror was sophisticated - it's more like a place you'd expect to find in a place like Chicago, Miami, or San Francisco. The atmosphere is impressive. I'll go back and try more food. My food was very good - but not wow. I only had one dish (corn soup with fried oyster), so I really do need to try more. The emphasis was on the contrasting textures of the dish and the flavor was neglected. By making the corn soup very smooth, it seemed to lose the toothsomeness that makes corn great. Maybe a better blender, clam juice, corn starch and butter, or spicy heat would compensate for the loss of corn fiber. Since the food is very good, and the restaurant exudes well - being, I'll go back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The food was quite good, the waiter was friendly and efficient, and we had a really nice time overall. Pros:*Really nice flexibility when we mentioned we were vegetarians. The waiter was a little thrown off with his information on first pass but came back and gave us some additional options. *The food was really well seasoned and prepared.*Nice wine list.*Our waiter did a great job of being there when we needed something, but not making us feel like he was bothering us by checking in too often.Cons:*12 South traffic and parking - they do offer valet, but it's just a really busy section of town*The noise level in the room got really loud really quickly. We were there on a weeknight, fairly early, and by the end of dinner we were having a hard time hearing each other over the general hubbub in the room. It looked like they had sound baffling installed, but it wasn't working that well.Child-friendly scale:*LOL. No. Vegetarian-friendly scale:*Reasonably good. There were a few vegetarian options available, enough variety that my husband and I could each try something different.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I love the ambience here, very quaint and upscale but not too pretentious. The brunch on the other hand was a little disappointing, although, the pistatio cherry sticky buns were amazing and was definitely the highlight of brunch! Do not get the eggs Benedict, it was recommended by the waitress as her favorite, but it was not the best eggs Benedict I've had. It was a small portion (where's the English muffin?), the menu clearly said Ham, and I was expecting a thick meaty piece of honey ham or something but what came was thin slices of prosciutto! What a let down, and the prosciutto was sooo chewy! The side salad was overly salty and lacked acidity. My friends all got sandwiches and burgers and were pleased w their meals. I just made a mistake. At least the Bloody Mary was great!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Amazing meal - really without flaw. Our party of four meandered slowly through the menu, which the waiter explained comes out in courses unless you prefer otherwise. For \"bites,\" we had the pretzel rolls (nice) and smoked trout, beautiful little stacks of fish on toast squares with an accent of cornichon. Yum.Then on to veggies.  I love these presented by themselves, given center stage. We had the Brussels sprouts and the carrots. The former were amazing, but the carrots - I have never tasted a more delicious carrot in my life. I could have made a meal of their earthy, smokey richness.Of course, we had to take a quick stop at pasta, enjoying pappardelle with a vegetable ragout that was an altogether different flavor experience. Loved it - one of our party said she could be happy with just that dish.We were talking and enjoying drinks and food and the atmosphere and the service and each others' company - I couldn't stop grinning like a crazy person.Not finally,  because we had to experience dessert too, we proceeded to meat/fish. I don't even care what anyone else ate. I ordered the pork jowl because I'd never had that before and, well, it's pork. The waiter explained it carefully,  to make sure I would be happy with the dish. It sounded intriguing,  so I went for it. It arrived as a perfect square of succulent meat with thin layer of mouth-melting fat, beautifully crisped on top and paired with a much more austere broth and vegetables that somewhat tempered the richness. I have never had anything like it. And honestly,  it felt like the meal had come to this incredibly exciting crescendo.Which means we probably could have done without dessert - chocolate donutty things and molasses tart. Both good, but you had me at jowl.We hadn't seen our friends for 10 years, so we were in no hurry.  At no point did we feel rushed, even though the place was hopping. It got a little noisy as it filled up, but that's understandable. An absolutely fantastic meal and evening - best I've had so far in Nashville.

The beef melted in my mouth, it was so tender I didn't even need my knife for assistance. Yes, I would definitely go back for the food!As far as aesthetics, the atmosphere is casually sophisticated and modern. Josephine has an air of \"fanciness\" but not so much that a wide range of foodies couldn't enjoy what it has to offer. Our server was the perfect balance of attentive and hands-off, all while being quite pleasant. The only \"not quite positive but not quite negative\" thing I would comment on is the noise level, but it wouldn't keep me from returning.Lovely, lovely restaurant!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Last week my Mom came to town and we wanted to go out for a nice dinner at a new place. Josephine has been high on my \"must try\" list for a long time now (many people keep suggesting it), and I knew that my Mom would really like the menu offerings. We were lucky to snag a day-of 7:30pm reservation, so we headed on down to the 12 south neighborhood. Once we were seated our waiter was very polite and friendly. I started with the Eastsider cocktail, made with gin, lime, cucumber and simple syrup. This drink was well balanced and very light, perfect for a hot Nashville summer night. I really liked how the citrus wasn't overwhelming and it let the gentle cucumber flavor shine If you have been reading me for a while, you know that I prefer the parts of the animal that some tend to describe as \"gross.\" Both my Mom and I love beef tongue, so this appetizer choice was a must. It was served on a sweet corn puree with a green tomato and cilantro salad. I loved how thick the pieces of tongue were sliced, making them extremely meaty. The braise of the meat made the top crispy and really added to the flavor while sealing in all the juices. The meat itself was tender, buttery and just fell apart in your mouth. The corn puree was sweet but the serving was small. They really should consider adding a bit more to the plate. The salad was a nice addition, adding some flavor and freshness to the plate, which complemented the heavy meat.One of the features I enjoyed on the Josephine menu was the prominence of the vegetable options. They all sounded very amazing, but we decided on the grilled rainbow carrots with curry granola, dill and a buttermilk vinaigrette. The presentation was amazing, with the carrots stacked row on row like a log cabin, creating a tall, elegant carrot-based structure. The carrots had a heavy smokey flavor, and upon asking our very friendly waiter, he informed us that they used hickory to smoke the carrots. The wood flavors blended nicely with the curried granola bits (which included oats and dried fruits.) The buttermilk sauce was weak in the mix and I felt it could have been more prominent on the plate to increase that nice tangy note. What I did have of the sauce was so delicious that I scraped up every last bit from the plate. When my Mom and I eat together we usually order two entrees and split them. The first offering was the beef cheeks with charred corn, green beans, leeks, and potatoes with a sweet onion glaze. The beef was rich and hearty while being tender. You can taste the sweet marinade and the hearty fat marbling. I'm normally not a fan of green beans, but these were great, due to what I assumed was about half a stick of butter coating all the vegetables. The mixture of the corn, beans and potatoes was an interesting take on traditional succotash and really livened up the heavy meat. This dish was outstanding, and highly recommended.The second entree was the duck breast with creamed corn, trumpet mushrooms and herb oil. The best part of this dish was the duck skin that was crisped up and laid on top. Few things make me as happy as duck fat/skin. The duck meat was very juicy, red, and perfectly cooked. The quality of this duck was very high, with a rather low fat content and flavorful meat. I really liked the cream corn on the bottom (causing me to realize that most of our dishes featured some form of corn). The cream corn was very thick, and reminded me more of a hearty corn pudding. The mushrooms were somewhat potato-like, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention how the herb oil lightened up everything, including the savory meat. For some reason after all that food, I still had room for dessert. How was this possible? I chose their interpretation of a peach shortcake, made with a sweet biscuit, peaches, blackberry sauce and whipped cream. The whipped cream was so light and fluffy the glutton in me wanted heaping cupfuls dumped on top. The biscuit was impressively sweet and light, not at all too dense. I think I might have to learn how to make a sweet biscuit now. The peaches were fresh and sweet and the tartness of the blackberry was a nice compliment to the sweet-overload. I was very impressed with Josephine. Every dish we had was well thought-out and beautifully crafted. Despite our surly hostess, our waiter and the rest of the staff were helpful, knowledgeable and prompt. The outside patio was a lovely spot to dine, although next time I would like to try the main dining room. And trust me, there will be a next time. Very soon!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We expected to wait a bit but luckily were able to get seated right away without any reservations. Our server was Abby and right of the bat she was extremely friendly and interactive with us and had great recommendations. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and were floored by the quality of flavor of something that looked so simple to make. It had the perfect amount of spiciness and flavor. I had the salmon and my wife ordered the beef cheeks. Very rarely do I like my wife's entree as much as mine but in this case both dishes were exceptional. Mine was probably the best salmon I've had in Nashville, it was cooked to perfection and on a bed of corn, tomato, leek, crab, and vermouth. The mixture made for almost a paste like texture that coupled with the salmon set it on another level. I was able to talk my wife into trading me a couple of bites of her beef cheeks in exchange for some of my salmon and it was a great experience on that end as well. The beef was cooked to perfection and was just easy to cut and eat and was full of flavor. The best thing was that the portion you get was just right, we were both extremely satisfied with the size of the meal after sharing the cauliflower. This was honestly one of the top 3 meals we've had in Nashville. Abby was great, she was friendly, attentive, helpful, and I felt like she was having just a good of a time as my wife and I were. We had never been to Josephine before but it will be one our stables from now own. Just an amazing place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I've heard good things, but was disappointed. Maybe it was because we didn't have reservations, and we sat at the communal table, maybe it was because we were more interested in appetizers and drinks than an actual meal, but our experience was not good. Very slow service, ordered meals that never came, and was genuinely not impressed with the food. Did I mention that the service was slow? I did? I'll say it again. It was extremely slow. I hate to see what it would be like at the peak of dinner service. So, if you take anything away from this post, remember this: go early and block off 3-4 hours of your time.

The food was exceptional.  I am from out of town, and this is the best meal I've had in a long time.  The duck breast with risotto was exceptional, as was the flank steak.  All of our appetizers were well seasoned and interesting.  The Brussel sprouts was the winner, living up to the reviews it received in the Times.  Add to this the great service we received, and we were pleased to have visited Josephine for our Thanksgiving meal out.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were seated promptly, which is always a plus, but that was the last thing that was prompt. Service and food preparation were extremely slow and a bit clunky -- for example, one of our party had ordered soup and an entree -- both items were brought at the same time - by the time the soup was done, the entree was long-cooled. The menu seemed to be fairly limited for brunch and the food was good but nothing that would lead me to \"Best of ...\" status.  Decor as others have noted, is simple but cool... I will say that the french-press coffee did rock the house.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The carrots were highlighted in Nashville magazine and were good (could be overpowering from the smokiness of them) yet we liked other dishes better. Under the new menu, the Brussel Sprouts were the best followed by the Buffalo cauliflower, similar to buffalo chicken. The pretzel bread was also good. I've had seafood in prior visit which was good yet liked the veggies at both visits best. Service from Brian was outstanding and wine is well priced with bottles often the price of 3 glasses which motivated us to go with a bottle.  This place is clearly giving the best spots in town a good run.

I know it's trendy in Nashville now, but how can people line up to spend their money on this stuff? What a horrible experience last night. Terrible selection of wine by the glass. A \"full service bar\" but not a single Canadian Blend on the liquor menu? The only steak on the menu is skirt steak; the cheapest and toughest cut available. Cow Cheek, which for twenty something dollars was 4 ounces of what tasted like MUSHY pot roast. I ordered a diet coke, $2.50, and later asked for a refill. These weren't cans of coke, it apparently came from a fountain. When the bill arrives I'm charged another $2.50......$5.00 for two medium size glasses of coke. The waiter highly recommended the house made pasta. Terrible! It was a bowl full of turnip greens, and room temperature. The only decent dish, ordered by one of our guests, was the scallops. However, 3 SMALL scallops for twenty something dollars.....why do that, ever again?\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's cozy, chic, and on trend. Our server was very informative and helpful in going over the menu (it's designed to be four courses, but you can kind of do whatever you'd like). We ordered a few things for the table, sipped on our wine and well crafted cocktails and just enjoyed the atmosphere. The heirloom tomatoes were amazing as were the rainbow carrots. The rainbow carrots are one of the most amazing things I have tasted. Do yourself a favor and get the carrots if you go. The portions are great - it doesn't look like a lot, but it is also not a daunting plate to look at - I could have eaten the carrots all by myselfMy friend ordered the beef cheeks and I was able to grab a bite - delicious again! They were melt in your mouth and had a great flavor. I myself got the steak with herb fries. Fantastic! The meat was tender and cooked perfectly and the fries were some of the best I have ever had!

    "comments": "I gave our dining experience a solid \"B-\" last night and my hubster remarked, \"what...you didn't like it?\" I explained that a B-anything is not shabby and it was something I aspired to all through my school years.There are many reviews already so I won't be repetitive. Jason's was very thorough so check it out here:  yelp.com/user_details?us…CONS: 1. Don't say you have \"sweet tea\" if what you mean is unsweet tea and you're going to bring out sweetener that I have to add. That's work that could easily be done back in the kitchen. Even if it's a cute little pitcher of simple syrup, I don't want to work at dinner. That's one reason you'll never see me order crab.  This is the South. Tea is sweet. And it's just polite to sweeten it in the back. Otherwise, say you only have unsweet tea and be honest.2.  The restaurant is smallish. They've done a lot with the interior but the size of the building is what it is. Because of this, every time the door opened, a few seconds later, a blast of cold, arctic air shot up my back...and we were seated in the middle of the restaurant!3.  Noise level. OK, so I'm borderline agoraphobic with a healthy intolerance for loud noises on a good day. Something I find just grating is when a group of ladies start hee-hawing and \"hey!\"ing and single-handedly lift the noise level in an otherwise quiet establishment. Our 6 pm reservation started off with a half-full dining room, mostly couples and 2 tables with children (no, as a parent, I would not say this is a child-friendly place and, frankly, I got away from my own kid so I don't want to look at or hear yours. Date night, people.). We sat at a 2-top, chair on one side/booth on the other table and were able to speak quietly across the table. By the end of the evening, I was employing lip reading and actually stuffed little tufts of toilet paper in my ears while in the restroom to help buffer/drone the din of the joint.4.  Dessert. The \"piece de resistance.\" The finale. The zenith. The epilogue. For those, like me, who are part elf and suffer through appetizers and main courses just to get to dessert, I must say I was disappointed by the sweets offering. It was too frou-frou. Too ostentatious. Just too. As a chef, I know \"those people\" want to put their spin, their signature, on every single plate that comes out of the kitchen. But dessert is the ultimate comfort food.  It's an epicurean way of saying \"there, there...everything's going to be OK.\" I don't need 12 ingredients on a plate that's supposed to be chocolate cake. I just want chocolate cake. A really good one. And, if you absolutely have to, you can drizzle some glaze on the saucer before you plate the cake or pipe some foam reduction or cream something or other on the side and top it with a fresh mint leaf, but this is a classic K.I.S.S. scenario:  keep it simple, silly.PROS:1. Valet parking.2. Pretty inside.3. Service was attentive, friendly & informative without being pushy, sarcastic, indifferent, rushed or hovering.4.  Food was delicious. And reasonably priced.5.  French press coffee. Divine.6. Bathroom. Guys, this will be lost on you, but, ladies, it was a nice restroom. 2 stalls. Cute sink. Nice faucet. Good quality, heavy paper hand towels. And yummy soap and lotion at the ready. Also, good placement/proximity of trash can to exit door for disposing of the \"door opener towel.\"WHAT WE ORDERED:- Skillet of pretzel rolls with mustard butter (appetizer)- Brussels sprouts, charred orange, dried cherry, peanut vinaigrette, rye onion rings (vegetable)- Beef cheeks, horseradish risotto, rosemary crumble (entree)- Josephine (hangar) steak, fries, herb butter (entree)- 2 UNsweet \"sweet\" teas- 2 coffeesLink to website:  josephineon12th.com\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I may lean toward 3.5 stars on this one, but I'll round up because of the carrots and brussels sprouts.  The ambiance is chic and modern and the restaurant itself isn't particularly big.  I started out with a wonderful cocktail, something bourbon-based, which whetted my palate.  We split the carrots and brussels sprouts to begin, on recommendation from other Yelpers, and man were they delicious.  The carrots were a rainbow of colors, wonderfully charred, and mixed with unique flavors such as a curry granola - never would have imagined the two together, but wow did it work.  The brussels sprouts were equally delicious and charred.  A great start!  We both opted for the fish entree - I can't recall what type of fish, but it was well cooked and on top of a bed created by a crispy potato pancake.  The flavors were nice, but it didn't really stand out to me.  I wish I'd gotten the beef cheeks...  I will say that, while the service was a bit slow and aloof, the waitress was incredibly kind when I ordered a glass of wine, which tasted off, and she allowed me to substitute another bourbon cocktail for no cost.I guess the concept of the restaurant is smaller sized plates with an emphasis on ordering four courses.  We stopped after the entree, with plans to go to Jeni's next door, so I can't speak to the dessert.  All in all, the restaurant was quite good.  I'd return, but there are plenty of other places I'd return to first.  Still, a nice evening out!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Not even that it was too pretentious: I think the balance between posh and laid back coolitude was there, but .. portion size is a downfall. As a European, I respect smaller portions. But these were just tiny, and if you want to leave full you have to go over the entire menu, which is a bit too pricey, especially considering all the other options you have.However, like I said, this has nothing to do with the restaurant; only my personal preference.Our waiter was extremely nice, we were well-attended and had a great time. Watching the crowd in the dim light is entertaining enough, and our table was right in the middle of the hall, so we had a lot of fun people watching. We shared beef tongue appetizer, beet salad and potato gnocchi and fish; everything was delicious. Afterwards we also thought that the size of the portions was just right: we didn't feel like we were about to explode, which often happens after finishing off the entire plate somewhere else.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The husband and I popped into Josephine last Thursday and sat at the bar for what we thought would just be an appetizer and drinks since we were planning to have dinner at another restaurant in the area.  Shortly after we started eating our appetizer, it started pouring outside so we decided to stay for our whole meal. We started with the Sourdough toast spaetzle which comes with Josephine's delicious house made bacon and an egg on top.  The melt-in-your-mouth bacon really makes this dish.  I also loved the sourdough flavor of the spaetzle. I continued my meal with the summer melon with hushpuppies and the beef tongue.  The melon dish was quite refreshing, and of course, the hushpuppies make the dish a bit more substantial and filling. The beef tongue had a nice overall presentation, and the meat was tender and flavorful. This was my first time eating tongue of any kind.  I was a tiny bit apprehensive but a coworker told me he really enjoyed this dish and I'm glad I ordered it!!The husband had the sweet corn soup with fried oysters and the beef cheeks.  He really enjoyed both.This was my 3rd time eating here.  I went for dinner shortly after it opened and recently for brunch.  I enjoyed the brunch especially since it was a beautiful day to sit on the patio, sip coffee and have a leisurely chat with my friend before browsing the 12South shops. Bottom line: well executed food, attentive, prompt service and nice ambiance.  I will definitely be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Dining in the open room, near the kitchen, seems more personal than the scattered rooms of Urban Grub restaurant down the street. The room is centered with a bar about the size of the eating bar at Green Hills Whole Foods. I enjoyed a tangy dish of beef tongue cooked over a live-fire grill. It paired well with a fine glass of Tennessee red wine which helped us \"chew the fat.\" A good finish is a Josephine dessert made with premium sweets like Jeni's or with Olive and Sinclair chocolate.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Came for a business dinner with several colleagues. Wine list was definitely impressive and enjoyed the ones we sampled. Didn't get a chance to have any of the cocktails.Atmosphere was great and looked like a nice mix of people there.Food was just ok. I had the quail, which was cooked and seasoned nicely, but the tiny quail was dwarfed by the mound of mashed sweet potatoes. Also would have liked to see more than just two tiny leaves of sage. Portions were definitely a bit off balance, but again, flavor was nice. As a table, we tried nearly the entire menu. Bites and Veggies were just ok. Nothing really \"wowed\" any of us, although we were all rooting for the chef to blow us away with the dishes. Colleague who got the beef cheeks seemed to enjoy it. Josephine chicken was beautifully presented and the chicken was good, but placed on a bed of cold Brussels sprouts, which was a bit of a miss for us. Desserts were really disappointing and presentation was lacking to the point of looking unappetizing. Definitely need a bit of work on the pastry side.Service was also a bit off. At times the server was unfriendly, and then at other times he was overly involved in our conversation. Just a bit awkward, but may have just been an off night.Overall, it still needs some work but there's potential.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My husband and I ventured to Josephine on a Monday night for a belated celebration of his birthday. While the restaurant wasn't crowded when we arrived, it certainly filled up. We brought a bottle of wine from home and ordered a couple of cocktails to enjoy while the wine was decanted. In a slightly bizarre turn, our waitress disappeared with our bottle of wine, presumably to decant it as we asked, and once we finished our cocktails, we had to ask for the wine and were never presented with the cork or anything. It was just a little odd. However, after being quoted $20 corkage on the phone and $15 corkage on Twitter, we weren't charged corkage, so I can't complain too much.Our cocktails were fine; nothing to write home about. I would've probably preferred to order just a martini rather than one of their artisanal cocktails off of the menu. Our server was attentive to explaining the menu and how it was designed. Other reviews have complained about portion size, but our server communicated that information to us very clearly.We started with the beef tongue and the cheese plate. Both were outstanding. The cheese plate was next-level, and I particularly enjoyed the housemade bread and unique cheeses.The star of the show was the Brussels sprouts. I've never had Brussels sprouts quite like these. The ingredients played off one another amazingly - bitter, sweet, nutty.My husband ordered the sourdough spaetzle with pork belly. I liked the fermented taste of the sourdough alongside the creamy, fatty pork belly and the tangy mustard. These dishes obviously have a lot of thought put into them.Our server tempted us with the roast chicken for two, which isn't something I normally order at a restaurant, but she said it was their signature dish. The presentation was beautiful, and then they carved it up back in the kitchen. It was enough food that we took a portion home, but we still needed to split dessert! I think we got the molasses tart. Evidently, it was not that memorable, and if it had been a little warmer, it would've been all to easy to skip dessert to go next door to Jeni's for ice cream.All in all, we had a very pleasant experience, enjoyed the atmosphere and the food, and will definitely return.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I like this bar because I've always easily found a seat at the bar before 7pm. You can also order from the full menu here so try the brussel sprouts! The bartenders are friendly and Nathan made me two off-menu cocktails: a pisco sour and his own spin on a Thai tea. I never go to the bar alone, but this particular time I felt quite comfortable sitting alone for a little while here. I appreciate the location of Josephine because it's in an active, lively neighborhood, yet the restaurant inside is calm, cool, and refined enough without being too bourgeoisie. The atmosphere of the bar is perfect. It's the first thing you see when you walk into the door so it never feels cramped by being tucked in a dark, back corner. It's spacious and there are tons of windows which allows light in as the sun settles. I liked being able to watch the hubbub right outside the restaurant as other Nashvillians, like me, were making their way to 12th South to find their favorite restaurant and welcome the weekend. The only reason I'm not giving Josephine 5 stars is because it definitely is pricey, especially for this area. Still, enjoy and support this local restaurant!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The restaurant is located on 12 South, and the decor is elegant and understated.  But who cares about what it looks like? Lets get to the food!Oh my god the Hanger Steak. I don't think any meat has ever melted in my mouth the way this steak did.  The delicious herb butter on top of it certainly didn't hurt, and the french fries were the perfect complement.  I also adored the beef tongue, the beet salad, and the rabbit and dumplings.  The beet salad had LAVENDER DRESSING. Get out.  It actually tasted like lavender and it was actually freakin delicious.  The chef, Andrew Little, is from Pennsylvania (my home state, represent) and it shows in his cooking. There is a \"molasses tart\" on the menu, but its shoo fly pie, y'all!  He is literally a genius in the kitchen, and I don't know how he puts the flavors and textures together that he does, but they say not to look a gift horse in the mouth, so...I will be back here as often as I can, and because they prices are extremely reasonable ($22 for the hanger steak, and so much food that even my gluttonous appetite was more than satisfied) I'll be back a lot!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Great AUTHENTIC Spanish tapas bar in Nashville.  I lived in Spain for some time and it was wonderful to have authentic tapas again.  This is a real gem and very hard to find across the United States...except in Miami.  This restaurant surpasses Spanish tapas places in NYC, Phoenix and Chicago...we are lucky to have it here in Nashville.  The food is the best part...we had classic sangria, jamon serrano, queso manchego, croquetas de jamon y manchego, albondigas, and hanger steak....all delicious.  The bread that was brought to the table was also very authentic Spanish.  The olive oil that was brought to the table was okay...there are better Spanish olive oils out there, but this was ok.  I am excited to go again soon and try more dishes...  I see that they also offer brunch, which is very interesting to me.  :-)  Excited for that!Overall the service was good.  I made reservations and felt like the gentleman that I spoke to was very accommodating, but also \"warned\" me about busy times.  We were seated before our actual reservation time.  Our waitress was good, explaining when we had questions.  The tapas came out at a good pace...slow to let us enjoy and digest.  It was really perfect timing.  My only small gripe was the bar.  I went there before my reservation, waiting for my friend to arrive.  The bar was very overcrowded and the bartenders seemed too busy...helping people out of order and people that were in larger groups.  I felt somewhat ignored and it took a while to put my order in.  As for ambiance, it is kind of a scene (which is annoying to me)...at least it was around 8pm.  As the night went on, it got a little better.  It was very loud inside around the bar.  We sat outside on the front patio and it was pretty loud there too!  I am not sure if there is a quieter part to the restaurant.  Next time, I will make my reservation for 9pm to miss the scene if possible!Overall great experience and looking forward to next time!Erica\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "First-timer for tapas, ever, so I was really excited to try Barcelona (and just not because its the name of one of my favorite bands). Luckily, my best friend made reservations for a big group for her birthday brunch today. There's limited free street parking, but if that's not an option, gravel parking right across the street for a few bucks will do. The restaurant is really cute, open and big. We were seated behind the feature wall in the back for some privacy, which was perfect. They offered us a 'group price' option, which I thought was a great deal, but unfortunately was either an all-or-none. So we just ordered individual tapas - including brunch tapas. Keep in mind, these are small plates so you should 3 minimum. They come out one at-a-time so you can enjoy each one thoroughly. I ordered 5 different ones - churros & chicken, pork belly benedict, croquettes, huevos estrellados, and the scallops. The huevos estrellados was my favorite - the potatoes were perfectly crispy and the eggs were cooked over medium topped with a flavorful sauce. Croquettes were crispy and cheesy. Scallops were tender, but just a tad bit salty. Chicken was good - moist and flavorful, however, churro was not crispy. Pork belly benedict was my least favorite - a little too rich for me, but not horrible. I took a few bites of the other plates including the shrimp and grits and seafood paella, both were good!I did not drink anything, but water, but they had a good list of wines, mimosas, and a bloody mary bar. Service was great, especially with a big group like ours. There was a number of selections that I wanted to try, so we will definitely be back - maybe for dinner next time!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The food was good this time as usual, but the service was subpar. Normally it is exceptional and this time it was average. I did see our server at the next table helping a man whose first language wasn't english and she was doing a good job.To start, they bring out bread and olive oil which is good.I had the tortilla española, which was good. It could have used a kick of something spicy, maybe in the sauce. The white sangria was great, and I'm not normally a fan of sangria. My friend had had the white before and didn't like it, so she tried the red. It came out more of a purple than a red, but she liked it. The brussel sprouts were great, as usual! Roasted, and a good portion. The scallops (3) were great, as was the broccolini. We didn't try it, but the \"Ramp it Up\" is a type of onion FYI.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was far from that. One of the best set ups in town and a ton on of space. The staff was courteous and and could fit any occasion whether it's date night, birthday, quick meal or even with kids. (Not the kind that wants to run everywhere though)  Our waiter was attentive and new the menu well. All of his recommendations were spot on. We literally ordered as many things as we can eat for 4 including 2 bottles of wine and a few cocktails. From their drinks, to bread, cheese plate/meats, I can go on everything was delicious. Out of the 20 or so items the only 1 was the pork chop from the platter was slightly dry but by that point I was so exited and on a high with how good Barcelona had been. As full as we were we needed to close the loop with dessert. We got the crepes and their strawberry pie. (Or whatever it was called) again it exceeded our expectations. Top notch food, great service, and wonderful ambiance. It is on my list to revisit soon. I'll need to try their brunch next.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Great new restaurant. They were slammed on Saturday night and the Manager was very accomodating. Spent some time at the bar and had a few appetizers and some nice wine (with good recommendation from the bartender). Big selection by the glass and bottle bottles.Manager sent over a couple of plates on the house.Sat down in the back room and tried many small plates with my daughter and her friend. Everything was great. Don't remember everything we ate but here's the stand-outs. Loved the jambon and machego cheese, the brussel sprouts and the broccoli. Was not crazy about the octopus. Nice flavor but did not like the texture. Not firm enough, a bit too mushy.Aside from that dish, a fantastic experience. Great server and lively atmosphere!Thanks, Barcelona, for a very enjoyable night.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Tried an array of different tapas this time around with the broccoli actually standing out as the best this time. Alas, my date did not want to sample the shishito peppers with me.However, I want to draw your eyes to the bottom of the menu to the Parrillada. The NY strip and pork were OUT OF THIS WORLD, but the sausage was a very dry chewy texture that I was not used to. Not sure how authentic NY strip is for a Spanish tapas, but hey it was good.Sampled the wine geek with my date, we loved the avinyo petillant and the other reds paired well with the Parrillada.

    "comments": "Top-notch dining experience from start to finish---and I don't even like to review chains as a rule((granted, this is a tinier one)), but when you have as good of an experience as my husband and I did here the other night, you just gotta spread the good word!!The atmosphere here is stellar in itself: nice lighting, huge bar, sexy vibe...can't wait to one day sip some Spanish wine on that big inviting porch!But the food was all equally impressive and served by several very knowledgeable and friendly servers to boot. Our first server steered us both into the perfect wines for our start((and not the most expensive either!)). We then started with lovely cheese wedges to nibble, the warm bread bucket was divine, the potato croquette and eggplant dish, plus some shrimp and noodles, a lovely salad, and so many other assorted nibbles that left us both impressed and stuffed to excess. And speaking of which, how cool was it that our server brought us an extra dessert for free since my husband and I couldn't agree on which one to share?! So the chocolate mousse and the crepes are both worth fighting over, just an FYI.Pleasant surprise upon the end: the bill was way lower than we both expected! God I love tapas!! Top that shocker off with a free tapas chip given to us for using next time just to complete a survey about our experience, and I'm officially a Barcelona fan girl now. Can't wait to come back and try even more treats there!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Oh, Barcelona. If I could some up this experience in one word, it would be: disorganized.My friends and I had dinner reservations and we weren't seated until 41 minutes (yes, I checked the time) AFTER our reservation time. When we kept asking about how long it would be until we were seated, the hostess wasn't helpful. They couldn't give us a time estimate which was SO frustrating. After we were seated, we were brought menus and ordered. The sangria and tapas came out in a timely manner & the manager came to our table to apologize for the wait. During our entire meal, we had people (I'm assuming they were waiting for tables) crowding near our table. It's somewhat uncomfortable to have strangers that close to you when you're eating. Our server was attentive at first but then we had a second server come by and said he was taking care of us so it kinda left us somewhat confused as to who was handling our table between the manager & two servers. We asked for a pitcher of water for our table & had to wait a while for that as well. The tapas were great. There's a wide selection but some of my favorites were the croquettes and potato tortilla. The sangria was spot-on as well. They have an extensive wine list which I would have tried if I didn't have to wait so long for our table...sigh. To make up for our wait, the manager treated us to three desserts, which was really nice of her. I would've rather some of the tapas or sangria be knocked off our bill though. Desserts were good - the crepes were my favorite. When it came to our check, we handed our cards to server number 2 & had to wait another 10-15 minutes to get them back. By this time, the restaurant was slowly clearing out so I have no idea what was going on/why it was taking so long. Overall, I think Barcelona has some work to do. It's a fairly new restaurant to Nashville but I think management needs to make some solid improvements if they plan to do well in this city.  Some suggestions - section off tables specifically for people who have reservations so that they aren't waiting 40+ minutes for their table. Additionally, figure out a way for people who are waiting for their tables to not be hovering around those who are trying to eat/drink in peace. The manager is the one person who saved this experience - she was very apologetic and sweet. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't come back here again based off of this experience. I will likely try Barcelona out one more time...but I'll wait awhile before doing so.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Hits were Ham/Tomato sauce meatballs, calamari, sweet potatoes and okra, as well as the manchego/speck/chorizo plate with a honey-ish jam perfect for the cheese. Also--the corn salad was excellent. The meh list featured the shishito peppers( actually, we found these to be atrocious), the Brussels sprouts, and the hanger steak, and beef empanadas which came recommended. Chloe served with humor and great attitude. Great but very loud atmosphere, cool and adventurous wine list, and my thought that the small plate movement should be the way we eat adds up to four stars.

Once our server explained the concept - small plates, think appetizers - it made a little more sense. BUT what she did not explain is that the food comes out one dish at a time. We each ordered three to four items and in a normal environment would expect all of the food to come out at once. It did not happen that way. First came the ham/cheese rolls for one person; then an order of fried Brussels sprouts for another person; then a dish of pickled strawberries for another; then the corn salad; etc. So it came down to only one person was eating at a time. At one point there was only a bowl of speckled beans on the table. We did not eat together. It was a meal that took almost two hours to complete and we left feeling hungry. It was very, very loud and while the staff was friendly, our server was not knowledgeable about the beer selection so again - confused.

We waited a little over half an hour to get our table, and I understand that it's sometimes difficult to move people out when you are dining tapas style, however, it was a bit frustrating to wait around with a reservation. Big I digress, we went to the bar and almost immediately were seated (the law of reservations). We started with a pitcher of red sangria to share and it was too sweet for us. Luckily, we had an incredible waitress and the manager was quick to come over and offer some suggestions on how to get it diluted a bit. An extra bottle of wine was perfect to add to our sangria! Deciding what to order was a struggle, and we asked for help. We had the shishito peppers, (amazing), brussel sprouts, sunchokes, croquetas potatoes bravas, squid ink cavatelli and a cheese board. Everything was fantastic, but the croquetas were just OK and I wouldn't order them again. I had a wonderful time and our waitress and the manager who helped us truly made the experience a stand out.

First off, the decor is absolutely perfect. It's dimly lit, boasts open bar seating and has nice wooden accents that give off that trendy, yet rustic vibe. Secondly, the wine menu is so extensive. I ordered a Malbec and was not disappointed. The tapas we ordered were all good, with the highlights probably being the squid ink cavatelli, the calamari and the chorizo with figs. I would have taken off a star for the price--it definitely is on the steeper side for both the drinks and the food; however, service was stellar.Our waitress was so sweet, and when we couldn't decide on a dessert to try, she gave us the churros for free!

    "comments": "Having dined at Barcelona in Atlanta, I was looking forward to their awesome Tapas menu and they definitely delivered. Especially since it was the soft opening, the staff and management were very visible. I I gave a surprising 3* for the high prices and the deafening music/noise levelFood: Everything we ate from the Tapas to the Grilled Meat platter was delicious except for the local sausage which had a pungent after taste.Prices: Very highly priced. This won't be a casual lunch/dinner stop for me unlike the loved Taco Mamacita next door. If they have 1/2 priced food Happy Hour like the Atlanta based competitor Eclipse di Luna, I will surely return several times weekly. *Hint Hint*Ambience: This is tricky. As much as the decor is beautiful. The 90db jarring noise level is an absolute turn off. Since the music is blasting, you practically have to scream to talk to each other and then they raise the volume to be louder than the talking. It was deafening and I had to go to my car to get ear plugs. When I brought it up to my server, a Mgr came by to explain that there have been guests complain about the volume but since it's part of their business plan to have a high volume, that he couldn't lower the volume. feel sorry for the staff that work there daily as they may have long-term hearing and other health problems. Family Friendliness: This is not a child friendly place as it is definitely not ear-friendly. I would wait for summer to roll by before dining outside away from the louder than Hard Rock Cafe noise level.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I'll start by saying that the food was wonderful and the ambience was fantastic! Though the waiter was nice, the staff in general seemed a little flustered by a large party (10) that chose to not do their \"party plan\" menus. It seemed like nearly every trip from the kitchen included an item that they had already brought with the last trip. Though we were grateful for the extra tapas, it just seemed disorganized. I also asked one of the staff members who brought us our tapas for some more bread, she nodded, turned around to find our waiter and said \"is this your table? They need bread.\" I guess they don't really work as a team... which is unfortunate. Team work makes the dream work, and it makes diners feel like they are never imposing on staff to accommodate needs. Anyway, it was a wonderful evening, filled with lots of laughs, great food, and satisfying sangria.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The hostess was very nice and even when she left to check on something two other team members stopped by to make sure we had been helped. We had two waitresses Amber and Aja(hope I spelled that right) who were both very polite and friendly. I ordered a mimosa first, which was very basic. I feel that it was a little overpriced at $10 for a simple flute glass. I ordered a few food items to try. First was the Huevos Estrellado which was absolutely delicious! The hot sauce that they top this with is very good and the potatoes were nice and crispy. I also ordered the Churros and Chicken. I liked the twist they put on this. Something different instead of chicken and waffles. The last thing was the Torrijas which is French toast. It was also very tasty. I had to get one more drink so I tried the red Sangria which was just okay. Kinda sweet for me and the apple pieces were cut to small and kept getting caught in my straw. Overall I thought it was really good and I would go back for brunch. I'll have to try dinner there and report back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was a Saturday and their brunch menu was just ending and dinner about to begin, so we tried a few off of each.    The butternut squash tortilla was not hubby's favorite.  We ordered a chartucceri with two meats and manchego cheese.  The Serrano ham was very good, pork sausage -Ok. Cheese was good. But paying over $5 extra for one large-ish slice was a pit pricy...Next time will stick with the Ham alone.  Our favorite dish by far was the calamari... Very fresh and delish.  We would order this again.   The pan seared grouper was above average, but small.   Overall, we will be back... It was an enjoyable meal and a fun place to go with friends.   I think there will be some tapas I order often and others I will skip...   Thrilled that there is something other than another upscale southern   style place.   Please keep improving the tapas....\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were a party of four and she called to make reservations, so no issues there.We ordered several tapas to share and enjoyed everything, some more than others. Highlights were the Brussels sprouts, fried cheese, roasted cauliflower, and chorizo with sweet & sour figs (my favorite - the flavors were unreal.) I think the only one we didn't super care for was the shrimp dish - it was flattened and puréed shrimp and was served cold, which we were not expecting. We still ate it! But definitely not the favorite.None of us drank that evening, so I can't comment on the wines, although their sangrias did sound delicious, and I'll be going back to try those :) The service was lovely, very friendly and attentive. We did seem to have 3 different servers waiting on us which got a tiny bit confusing, but they were all wonderful, so no real complaints! PS be sure to ask for bread - it's free, but we didn't realize we needed to ask for it until halfway through our tapas. You want the bread to accompany some of them, trust me!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Really everything they have on the menu is good, I've never been disappointed. The wine list is endless and the cocktails are also on point.

Our servers were fantastic, offering drink and small plate suggestions and effortlessly personable. Despite a hectic flow of guests, our drinks were served (and replenished) quickly, and our food was fresh and flavorful--definitely recommend the potatos bravas and brussels sprouts. My friend had the drunken goat cheese and loved it as well... the restaurant has a really fantastic ambience, a pretty decent wine + cocktail list, and is much larger than it appears from the entry, and we had a really wonderful time. So much so, I returned within the next week! :) Street or paid lot parking, really accessible area in Edgehill. Can't recommend enough--date night, girls' night, group dinner... you won't be disappointed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Took awhile and some careful ninja moves (and maybe a little lack of manners) to squeeze myself and my date into a bar seat (table seating was approx. 1 hour wait).  It seems to be a very popular trendy establishment at the moment for young professionals. LOVED the wine list! Lots of options to choose from. I'm a Malbec lover personally and they have some wonderful options that most restaurants don't cater to. From what I understand they don't have a license to serve beer yet, but their wine and cocktail options greatly make up for it. The food is small plates with a variety of tastes. The calamari was delicious with a light butter breading and garlic aioli dipping sauce. The carrots are deliciously interesting! They are topped with a sauce and fish roe which sounds 'odd' yet somehow it works. We had a few other plates and all were nicely prepared and seasoned. No complaints! I really enjoyed the creativity of the plates and that they were smaller sizes to allow for more of a 'snacking' while enjoying a couple glasses of wine. Wonderful trendy atmosphere. Friendly bartenders. Great food. Definitely a place to recommend.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "In headline news: Nashville, we have finally filled that gaping tapas void in our culinary scene. No \"southern mash up\" dining, Barcelona is forefront delicious food & exceptional service and you will be filling your belly on some of the most delicious and authentically fine Spanish tapas plates this side of the Atlantic. Taste that smoked paprika - feel the heat on that spicy broth as you soak it into your last bite of bread. Let that char from the grilled octopus meld in your mouth with the flavors of pickled peppers, turning suddenly into this phenomenoal almost sharp cheese-like extreme flavor. Get your umami overload with their spectacularly generous, outrageously flavorful garlic aoili while you dip in your extra-crispy edged potato bites, thinking \"Hey, isn't this the exact texture we are joyfully expecting whenever we read 'duck fat' on the menu?!? But this is presented so flair-less and delivers so much more!\"Tapas has it's own special place in my heart - Barcelona the city was my first \"big girl trip\" out of college. I strolled the streets with my sister on a tapas tour and we spent the week joyfully filling our table with little plates from the tapas menu, repeating favorites around the city and comparing. The only place in the US I've ever felt did a decent job at tapas is Jose Andres' Jaleo in DC and the last time we went there, the service made me fall seriously out of love.Enter another new tapas place in Nashville...a purist menu without that \"southern mash up\" thing we're tending to do now left me thinking \"It's got potential...\" but I didn't get my hopes up. Still, the prices looked right and Nashville - despite the food scene we're growing - has 3 or 4 serious voids in it. The tapas places in the past that have popped up haven't been phenomenal, haven't lasted long or haven't really focused so much on the Spanish tapas style as the actual use of the word tapas (think Little Octopus which is PHENOMENAL tapas...but I wouldn't hold a Spanish candlestick to it any day). Barcelona is dimly lit (boo for food photos, but lovely to dine in), packed with tables, a little too loud for me and enshrouded in wooden walls and benches and an assortment of plants. It smells seafood-y and wood fired and inviting as soon as you reach the front steps. We were seated in an awkward spot in the corner and never forgotten about by our two waiters. The water glasses were always full, our waiter explained the \"wine flights\" to us knowledgeably and in a way that made picking easy, and seemed to perfectly estimate the exact time it would take us to agonize over limiting our tapas choices and make our selections.Wine flight - was really great. I didn't think I'd be drinking but the flight sounded tempting and splitting made it do-able! Patatas Bravas came out first. These are my weakness from Barcelona. We must have had a dozen or so of these from different places all around the city and it's usually the first dish I pick on any tapas menu. I've never felt satisfied with the entire presentation at any dingle place except our last night bar in Barcelona - a narrow place with a Barcelona football match on the TV over the kitchen. Crispy-edged thick cut potatoes, a whopping dollop of super garlicky aoili, the thing red pepper sauce on the base bringing some acid and a high quality coating of smoked paprika dusting the top...it's like I'm back in that bar, the dish was so perfect I described both the romanticized memory and my dinner start last night. Grilled octopus with pickled olives and cherry peppers, porchetta with a pesto, spicy capavati squid ink pasta with shrimps and chorizo, confit crispy duck leg. Every dish was presented beautifully and the flavor layers and combos made for some really delicious bites. Interestingly, in all cases the combination of everything on the plate - sauce, veg and meat - always turned into the \"best bite\" rather than tasting a pure grilled octopus or just a bit of crispy duck. Both were delicious, but both got better when combined with the confit potatoes and parsley in a sweet sherry glaze, or the pickled sweet-sour tang of olives.All-in the meal lasted 2 hours. We finished up with desserts, one a flavor-piled chocolate mousse with banana puree and salted chocolate crumb - not too sweet, so much yum - the second a flan - caramely-vanilla-y melt in your mouth goodness. I'd call the chocolate mousse a chocolate pudding, but I'd still tell you to eat that yum on yum pot of \"that's how we make dessert taste indulgent and not just chocolate.\"Service - front of house here is knowledgeable, excellent at attending tables and really friendly. We did experience an intermission on the tapas for a while after the first 3 came out in just a few minutes - our waiters both came around to keep us up-to-date on food progress, keep our water glasses filled and offered to grab more bread for the table if we needed. They more than made up for it in flavor and dessert on the house. Pros.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I found out however that there was one in Nashville. Now I love me some tapas. I like no frills simple and yet complex tapas. I've learned that a good dish can be good if you just play up it's basic goodness. It's kind of like you know you have quality food if it still tastes good when it's cold.Back to tapas, they were impeccable. I wanted to be disappointed at something  (my standards were pretty up there) but I couldn't. Boy did they deliver. The fact that they stay open till midnight on weekends is a plus for me and any of you night owls out there. Everything I put in my mouth just melted me in my seat and I found myself in another childhood memory. \"Where's the membrillo\" If you don't have it on the menu, you should get it. It'd be a great accompaniment to the cheese. Regardless to say, I expected nothing and came out with an absolute feeling of bliss. Nashville has needed this. Thank you restaurant Gods for blessing us with such an awesome much needed late night place. I shall come back with more foodie warriors next time. I'll try not to order everything off the menu.

Great atmosphere, absolutely fantastic tapas (at a slight premium, but I would argue that it's worth it), and the sangria is delicious as always. You really can't go wrong here.The only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was that the wait staff seemed a little inexperienced. Although they were really friendly and generally attentive, I had red sangria spilled on me and then oil from another dish shortly after. Then, after the server apologized profusely, she said she would get me club soda to put on the stain, but never came back.  I had to awkwardly ask someone else for it. It's a new place, and I get that mistakes happen (twice?) But what really sucked was at a nice place like this, you expect them to at least comp you something when this kind of thing happens. But nothing. Didn't even really acknowledge that it happened.  That bummed me out as I'm sure it would have been different had I caused a scene, but that's not my style.But I only took off one star because I know there will be some growing pains. Would come back for sure but would take off another star if I have another problem.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We ordered the pretzel appetizer, then each of us had the Bibb lettuce salad, we are vegetarians, so we ordered them without bacon. As an entree we each ordered the agnolotti. It was wonderful albeit small. My one and only criticism would be that the portion sizes were just not quite enough.

    "comments": "AMAZING! I will start off by saying that I am a harsh critic - and I rarely leave reviews on Yelp. I have spent a couple years serving in a fine dining establishment, so I definitely know service and food! Josephine blew me away - we ordered the brussels, beef tongue, scallops, and pork belly dishes. ALL were wonderful! We were brought the french press coffee and a dessert on the house, for no reason at all. I cannot explain the impact this hospitality had on our experience - it was very much appreciated, and it is hard to find in Nashville! The wine selection could expand a little (I am a fan of dry, full-bodied cabs), but that is the only constructive comment I could possibly make. Service is FANTASTIC. Our bartender Nathan was kind and very helpful. We stayed from open to close on a Sunday during dinner (we know...), and he never made us feel rushed. He made sure our experience was amazing from beginning to end. Servers Abby and Casey were in the section near our bar seats, and they certainly contributed to making our experience unforgettable! Those two have a joy about them that make the whole restaurant a brighter place to be! DEFINITELY worth the dollars! :)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The best way to describe this place?  It's like Josephine is having an affair with some guy named Bubba...and she should really know better.  Being this restaurant is from the owner(s) of Burger Up (which is spot on in what it does in every way - food, wine and decor), I was SUPER excited to try this place.  BIG disappointment.  I'm a serious foodie.  Whether it's a five-star restaurant or a shack on the side of the road in third world country - love it all as long as it's good.  So, the international wine list a reviewer mentioned?  I LOVE me some red wine.  Do not mess with my wine, okay?  haha  Took me three red tastings to get an average wine I finally settled for.  There was the Merlot that tasted like a tinny, watery Barolo.  Then there was the Malbec (which I ALWAYS love) that tasted like a thin, flat Merlot.  Finally, got a Cab that was like a medium-bodied, average Merlot.  WTH?  Few things I love more than wine and one of them is cheese.  How can you screw up a cheese plate?  I'll tell you how...with pumpernickel bread.  Huh?  I couldn't even taste the cheese so the kitchen brought me some pretzel bites (seriously? why are these on the menu to begin with?).  And, laughably, the cheese plate was garnished with peanuts.  Plain peanuts.  Like Planter's.  If they were roasted almonds with sea salt?  Sure.  Bring them on.  But gas station peanuts?  The menu is extremely unfocused.  The decor...perplexing.  The bar and the area to the right works and is cohesive - French bistro with an American rustic flare.  Got it.  But then you look to the left.  Oh, dear.  The VFW hall was made into a dining area.  The booth height proportions are off and overly tufted with what looks to be burgundy vinyl from a 50's Italian restaurant.  The large mirrors are unnecessary and overkill with the huge glass windows in the front.  The table and chair selection must have come toward the end of the budgeting process.  And if you're going to go eclectic with mismatched chandeliers, you'd better nail it.  They didn't.  I'm telling you, I was SO disappointed because I truly wanted this to be a shining star.  I'm not sure what happened between Burger Up and this place, but the disconnect is shocking.  Josephine, honey...now about this Bubba guy...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

However, the hostess' quote of 15 or 20 minutes turned into another 15 minutes and after that another 10 minutes. We were not on a schedule, but we would have appreciated a wait time within five minutes of what we were quoted (as times are usually quoted longer than necessary). Once seated our server did not appear until we had time to look over the whole menu and choose drinks and entrees -- so everything was ordered at the same time. When my food arrived it was SO salty I could barely eat it -- big chunks of it on the bun of my sandwich. I was chugging water to make up for it, and was disappointed I couldn't make out any other flavors beyond the salt. I wanted to like this place, but the service was bad and the food was nothing to shout about. We would give it another try if it wasn't so pricey for what we got.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We both ordered delicious Cocktails too start off, along with a decadent cheese plate. As far as the Bites go The Molasses glazed veal sweetbreads were amazing. For dinner we ordered the brussels sprouts to share and I would be lying if I didn't say that they were easily the best brussels I've ever had... just do yourself a favor and try them. For the entrée I ordered the Beef Cheeks and they were melt in your mouth delicious. Had a bite of my wife's Scallops and they too were awesome. Seriously, everything we tried was tasty!

I think they said they smoked their bacon in-house. I could be mistaken, but it was great regardless. It was cooked in that sweet spot of not-too-crispy, not too floppy, but perfectly chewy. Then they added thick slices of heirloom tomato. I loved it. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a BLT more as I typically don't go on and on about them. My co-diner had their French omelette with fries. He's a picky eater, and this was his dream breakfast. I tried the omelette, it was pretty perfect. It comes with just cheese, but you can add stuff for an additional charge. I had a non-alcoholic mixed drink that had elderflower and muddled berries and club soda. It was super refreshing. I'm only giving four stars for now until I can go back for dinner which I've heard great things about. I can't wait to go back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The basis of my three star rating has everything to do with the food, drinks, and prices. My dinner companion and I had the clam bites to start, followed by the brussels sprouts (which came out independently of our entrees), and I had the Josephine steak while she had the scallops. We both had a manhattan. The clam bites were bland and the deep frying was a bit heavy-handed. The brussels sprouts were beautifully arranged, but also fairly bland; though it was a unique take on brussels sprouts I have not encountered before with an interesting citrus pairing. Still, just nothing all that tasty. The steak came with a *lot* of fries and was OK. I wasn't looking for a big plate of fries, but since they were there some ketchup would have been great; there was no ketchup in the restaurant, which was a particularly big bummer since I'm a huge fan of Burger Up's ketchup (and they share an owner). The scallops were the highlight of the night; totally delicious and highly recommended.Meanwhile, our manhattans were subpar; too much dry vermouth.All in all a nice night out, but the menu needs a little work to match the prices and decor.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was very disappointed when the \"special\" menu listed what you could order for the meal and the best appetizer and the beef entree required an ADDITIONAL CHARGE!  Basically, if you ordered the appetizer and beef entree it cost $22 more, almost a 50% up charge!  Have you heard of bait & switch!!!  When you promote a special at a set price then that is what it should be! I called to talk to the manager to voice my concern. On my first call I had to leave a message on an answering machine. Do you think I received a return call? NOPE!  I called again and a \"manager\" seemed surprised that I would be upset about the up charge on their \"bait & switch\" menu, but assured me the \"General Manager\" would give me a call to discuss. Do you think I received a return call? NOPE. Fixed price menu with up charges...bad idea, bad customer service. Not returning customer calls...bad idea, bad management, bad customer service!  I guess I can spend my food and beverage dollars someplace else and hope you do as well!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Service was spotty, had about 5 people checking on us throughout the night, but none of them communicated with each other, so they kept asking the same things over and duplicating efforts. Our main waitress was nice and seemed to be knowledgeable of the menu, as she was from another location and seemed to be helping the new place transition. They do have some kinks to work out, but I love wine and tapas, and there was a good amount on the menu. But beware those plates add up to a fancy meal elsewhere. I had to google a lot of the menu since it was mainly in spanish and gave little description. The cauliflower was probably my favorite and i LOVED their olive oil that came with the bread. Great quality. The ham/cheese bites were ok and as much as I adore real paella in a cast iron skillet, it was just ok, as well. Braised short ribs and gnocchi was tasty. All the plates are perfect for sharing. Would make for an excellent date night. Outside patio is also great because they have tons of heaters and blankets making it super cozy and romantic.

An excellent addition to the edgehill village area.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I went to Barcelona on a Wednesday night two months after it opened and there was no wait. Don't go to City Winery anymore; go to Barcelona instead. Everything I had was delicious-- the hanger steak, patatas bravas and brussel sprouts. You won't regret spending a few hours here!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

There were three of us in our party and we were seated in the back area of the surprisingly large restaurant. Our bottle of wine was delicious and very well priced. Between the three of us we ordered a charcuterie and cheese board and nine tapas. Everything tasted very good, however there were a few stand outs. The drunken goat a la plancha was the hit of the table, as was the braised lamb neck with polenta. The charcuterie board was also of very high quality, though didn't come with bread/crackers unless you asked for it or accepted their offer of it. However we didn't realize until after the fact that that was the only bread available for the charcuterie. Overall the atmosphere in the restaurant was very lively, the service was on point, and the food was great!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So upon entering, I really loved the appearance and decor.  The restaurant was busy and the bar was full.  We were seated at a tiny booth in the bar which was very uncomfortable and the music was incredibly loud. We were moved to a table away from the bar and although the seating was much more comfortable, the noise was still overbearing. Our servers were just interested in taking our orders and made no suggestions, even after encouraging them to tell us about the menu and the items they liked. We ran out of water, we ran out of bread and olive oil and had to flag one of our servers for service.  The wine list was really intriguing and I was expecting them to highlight the Spanish wines and help me make selections.  Not the case at all.  I blindly selected a reasonably priced wine that I was pretty sure was a red, and was served the wine in a wine glass that smelled like a dirty fish tank.  I once again, flagged the server about the glass and he replaced it relatively quickly.  But that's another point, the service was beyond slow.  I mean, I cannot begin to understand how it took three hours to eat our meal. I work in fine dining, and although this wouldn't be considered fine dining, service is still service and this was appalling.  The quality of the food was fine.  Nothing was exceptional or outstanding, or at this point memorable, because of all the other distractions: bad service, loud so you can't hear each other, crowded, and dirty menus.  I came based upon a recommendation and reading other reviews.  We will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We enjoyed when our server came by on another servers shoulders and poured wine in our mouths until we told her stop! It was hilarious and a lot of fun.  Ordering tapas can get pricey and you can get stuffed quickly so I recommend doing what we did, by getting a couple at a time so you don't over order.   The restrooms are not easy to get to if you are in the front of the restaurant, especially when its as crowded as it was last night, you have to go around the entire enormous bar in the center to go down the back hall to get to them.... but really thats my only complaint and it's really not that biggadeal.  Would love to come back when its warm and enjoy some wine on the patio...and get about 3 servings of those shishito peppers!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Two hours later we were seated and just give  a small cheese plate and one other very small dish as an apology for the wait. The host was very short with us when we would check on our status, which we did several times because we waited TWO hours. Shame on us for even waiting that long, but we did at least manage to have a close spot to the bar to wait. There were four of us in our party, so eating at the bar was not an option. Management's service was disappointing once we were seated considering how much we had already spent at the bar. I'd say it worth all the excitement for a chain restaurant.

Try the manchego croquettas, the shishito peppers, the fried Brussels sprouts, and the papas bravas as tapas, and my friend and I got one portion of the veggie paella, which is amazing with the garlic aioli sauce the pride. Also, as a carb addict, can attest to how good their bread is. Finished off with a glass of red (they have a great selection) and my night was made.

With a plethora of shapes, sizes, colors and flavors, you are sure to find something miraculous. I'm a huge fan of their spaghetti. I never thought about how delicious pasta along could be, until I came to this place.I've never eaten in the restaurant, but they did have a booth at a local event I went to. They were serving spinach gnocchi, meatballs and french bread. The whole event their line was out the room and by far the busiest.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Great for picking up for a night in when you want to eat something quality.My problem is the last 2 times we've been here, our order has been wrong. The wrong sauce on the wrong noodles, being charged $14 for a salad they forgot to add chicken to, etc.And for the most part the staff has been unapologetic about these mistakes. (Even arguing with us once that the cheese sauce WAS in fact alfredo. We've been here over a dozen times and know the difference.)All that said, check your orders before they leave the counter, AND check your receipt to make sure you're charged for the right things.

    "comments": "Nicolettos is one of those places that makes you go \"dang I should have thought of that\" they take such a simple premise of making a fast food style assembly line pasta dish but execute it so perfectly  that you feel you are taking home a dish from your favorite white table cloth joint in downtown. All the pasta is home made and you start your selection from their rotating case of pasta creations. Recent examples include red pepper fettuccine, basil angle hair, spinach and kale penne, and my favorite any type of gnocchi. Add your sauce, Alfredo and red sauce is always on tap the Alfredo in particular is thick creamy and delicious. You will also find specialty sauces like walnut pesto. Finally add your protein rosemary chicken or Italian sausage and peppers are two favorites of mine. And there you have it. Your pasta dish will be ready in a few minutes. Get some delicious thick crusty bread with it and it's probably the only meal you need for the day. As a bonus you can take your pasta next door to Mickeys for a drink, or trek home lay out a table cloth and wine transfer the pasta to a plate and no one will ever know you got this delicious meal for 10 or 12 bucks and in just a few minutes. They also now carry sandwiches, but really at least give those delicious homemade noodles a try before going off script you will not regret it.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We'd recently come back from Lexington where we'd at ate Lexington Pasta Garage. That place was amazing and after seeing this place, I thought that it would be a lot like it. They were kind of alike, although I enjoyed Lexington Pasta Garage more. More about that below. We came by for lunch on a Saturday around 1pm. They close at 2pm then open back up again later in the day. They've got a large menu that is only available for 9pm-2am Thursday through Saturday which was a bummer. We were able to build our own pasta as the simple & straight forward menu board says. I picked the Porcini fettuccine with Alfredo sauce & Italian sausage. The price is $6.95 for pasta & sauce, then more if you get the 'market pasta' which the porcini was, & $2 for a protein add in. So it was $9.95 for my dish. We also ordered the spinach gnocchi ($8.45, it was $1.50 more for gnocchi) & tossed in pesto. The location is on busy Gallatin Pike. We found a parking spot up front, but I bet there's only 4 spots in the front, with some parking along the side & back of the building too. The inside isn't too big. They've got 3 long tables along the walls, with stools for seating. There's a case that has all the pastas that are available. The girl working the register on our visit wasn't too friendly, I think we interrupted her break maybe because after she rang us up, she went into the back & started to eat something & was on her phone. The food doesn't take too long, just boil the pasta, pour sauce & meat on top. You get a piece of bread to go along with it. Who doesn't like to clean a saucy plate with some bread?! The portion was pretty good for the price. It's not cheap, but I didn't feel like it was highway robbery (who gets robbed on the highway anyway?). I really enjoyed the Italian sausage in my dish. The sauce was rich & creamy. The noodles were good, except for I kept finding noodles stuck together. Kind of odd for that to happen at a place that specializes in noodles. With them clumped together, it made it chewy in some bites. The spinach gnocchi was good, however I prefer with the gnocchi has that slight sear on the outside to give a little texture.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I thought that was pretty cool, because if he hadn't said anything I was thinking of getting a different, more random sauce that perhaps wouldn't have gone so well. Thanks dude behind the counter!

But... the Porter Road meatball, not so much. The texture and flavor of the meatball really bugged me. Considering that the meatballs are $5 extra, I wasn't feeling the value. I would give a firm 3.5 if possible. If they get rid of those meatballs, they'll be an easy 4-4.5. I feel like the price point keeps them from reaching a 5, as the restaurant feels kind of like a fast food spot, but an order of  spaghetti and meatballs will set you back about $15.

    "comments": "I was drawn into the place strictly by the words \"Italian Kitchen\"  I had driven by often, but hadn't done any research, nor had anybody in my circle talked about this place.  I went in with an empty stomach and an open mind.  It was 4:00 in the afternoon, so a late lunch.  I was reading the chalkboard above the pasta display case, when the cashier asked how he could help.  I hope he was new, because I asked him what I should have, and he said, \"hey, we sell pasta.\"  And he was right, they had 10 or 12 different kinds of freshly made pasta and a bevy of sauces in the steam table right there in front of me. I didn't want to think, so I ordered The Italian beef sandwich and a caesar salad to go.  I looked around while I waited for my order...I was alone in the place.  It was very neat and clean.  It was not a place I would actually stay and dine, especially with friends, because it's bar stool seating along the window drink rail.  The retail \"merch\" was the usual branded stuff with a heavy buy into the Vespa brand, interestingly enough. There was several people working in the tiny space and I am not sure how they kept from tripping over each other.  The uniform of the day seemed to be big ear plugs, tatoos and facial hair.  Not judging, just commenting.The guy preparing my sandwich was very careful and precise, and when we handed my my order, his was the only friendly face and voice I have experienced during my entire visit.My sandwich was everything I remember about the Italian beef I used to get in Chicago and more.  There was a good beefy flavor from the Porter Road beef and nice spice from the vegetables.  The bread was the perfect amount of messy dripping goodness.The caesar dressing was very tasty, but I wish my romaine have been less yellow and more green.  It was like looking at a bowl of shaved parm.I have mixed feelings.  It would be better to call this a pasta bar then Italian Kitchen.  I wanted to see lasagna, stuffed shells, chicken parm.    I wanted to smell garlic bread.  I REALLY wanted a cannoli!  What I had was good and the value was there.  In my head, you eat pasta when it comes off the stove, not out of a carry-out container 15 minutes later.  Would I go back?  I would go back if I could buy the fresh pasta and a container of sauce and then make it at home.  The flavors of the homemade pasta sounded delicious.  And maybe I can do that, but I didn't see that as an option on any of the signage.I can see where parking could be an issue also.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

On another note, I got extremely sick after eating a (delicious) sandwich on their late night menu. Not sure if food was undercooked or what, but I definitely have food poisoning.

    "comments": "Let me start by saying the guy behind the counter was AWESOME! Great customer service, super friendly and cool AF. Now the \"meh\" part of the review. I ordered \"Naked Balls\" (laughed hard when I ordered it too) which consists of TWO VERY VERY SMALL meatballs (one was crusty/overcooked like it had been on the bottom of the pan for hours and never stirred), some marinara sauce, a pinch of cheese and a 2\" piece of bread (no pasta - hence the naked balls name) for $7.95 plus tax ($8.68ish) DEFINITELY NOT worth it for the portion size. Should have been like $3.50 at the most. Not to mention the flavor was not great. The sauce had good flavor, but the meatball was spicy, and while I LOVE spicy food, this was a weird kinda of spicy. I couldn't figure out what was making it spicy and I know spices! I ate the one meatball that wasn't overcooked and the very tiny piece of 2\" bread (which was tasty) and I threw the rest away. Total waste of almost $9.This was my first time at the restaurant and I heard rave reviews about their food but I can honestly say I was not impressed. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon. Small portions, high priced, and sub par food. Nope, not again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Wonderful pasta, wonderful service, and wonderful space!My friends and I went to try them out on their opening day and they were fantastic. The three of ordered different meals and everyone was super satisfied. I had the campanelle pasta with pesto and meatballs. It was served with herb focaccia bread but the star was the pasta and the meatball with a kick. Mine cost $15 because there was an up charge for the campanelle and for the meatballs.  They asked me if I wanted parmesan or basil added to my meal which made my very happy!My friend had spinach fettuccine with alfredo sauce with meatballs and my friend had the freshly made tortellini with marinara sauce. Her marinara sauce was one of the best I have ever tasted. It was light and super tasty. We also had the tiramisu which was pretty good. We were all super full by the end of our meal. Our food was served in a plastic bowl and has a top for easy takeaway with plastic forks, knives, and spoons placed where you pick up your food. You'll order and then you can stand around or sit to wait. They will call your name for you to pick up your order.My friends and I were super pumped about late night menu that happens Thursday-Sunday from 9PM-2AM. Who doesn't want a meatball sub, some green chili mac n' cheese or fresh cut fries with yazoo gerst beer cheese after a fun night out? We're pumped to come back. Thanks for opening up a store front. There is only bench seating against one wall and then the other is window seating that faces outside. I would say that it can seat 12. Hopefully they'll get so busy they will have to expand! You can also buy their homemade pasta to take home too!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

So much for dinner.  We ate Campbell's soup and a bologna sandwich!I will give Nicoletto's the benefit of the doubt, and say that there are probably some people who like their Italian food super spicy hot and ultra garlicky.  But we are not among them.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'll start with the good: pastas are fresh, amazing Italian beef (Chicago vibe), late night menu is cool (and you can eat at mickeys) - friendly staff and clean as a can be. Priced reasonably, but by no means cheap. Negatives? For starters, their Marinara could not possibly be more forgettable. Watery, bland, etc. Caprese salad is light on basil and the balsamic reduction, which basically makes it a bowl of tomatoes and mozzarella balls. Caprese is the simplest dish. How do you screw this up? Portillos is a fast food joint in Chicago and even they have decent marinara. I'm giving it 4 stars because I feel like compared to the other crap in East Nashville, this place is solid.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The portions are large, the price is right, but the flavor was lacking. The marinara was average to me - even though it was recommended as amazing. My meatballs were raw - the guy behind the counter made me a new bowl and apologized. The focaccia served with the meal was delicious. I can make pasta at home - home made pasta - most people can and do. I can also make pesto, alfredo and red sauce - the only sauces they offer. So for a place that only serves pasta with a few sauces I was expecting more than a macaroni grill taste. There was nothing different or exciting about Nicoletto's.

We both had the spinach fettuccine - mine with pesto and veggies, my husband's with pesto and marinara mixed (at the suggestion of the cashier) and the vegan meatballs. They were both incredibly delicious - especially my husband's. There is limited seating so we took it home. All the pastas come with fresh bread and are very reasonably priced (about $9 each). We will absolutely be back. My husband wanted to go back the next day, but they are closed on Sunday. Counting the hours until Monday lunch...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Nicoletto's is an extremely well executed casual Italian concept. The pasta is handmade each day, in addition to a variety of sauces. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about their product. A visit here won't break the bank either, with prices being truly moderate, particularly in consideration of the quality of food provided. Not only are they open for lunch and dinner, but they offer late night hours Thursday through Saturday. If you can't get enough of their pasta during business hours they offer dried versions of their pastas and flours produced at a local factory. Bravo Nicoletto's for providing real, fresh Italian quickly and at a reasonable price.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Maybe they were just having an off night or I need to try something different next time? The marinara sauce is pretty bland and you don't get nearly enough of it to cover the pasta. The focaccia bread was dry/bland and in desperate need of some sort of dipping sauce or oil to accompany it. The Caesar salad wasn't good either. Hate to say it but I've had far better at Italian chain restaurants...was disappointed that the quality wasn't higher here.

Create your dish by choosing from 4 or 5 sauces, pasta varieties, and meats. There are a few salads as well, and bread has come with our orders. Have tried a couple combinations and salads, and portions are generous, everything has been tasty and fresh, and it's under ten bucks! Friendly staff and reasonable wait time of under 10 minutes (pretty sure you can order ahead too). They've made the best of the small space and created a ledge with stools around the perimeter so you can eat in, I think most folks are going to carry out.

Followed by the manager giving him a look like of course we are dummy.  I'm not saying the pasta hit the floor or anything but it defiantly hit the side of the pot/counter top etc.....  We took it to go, I ate one bite of the Spinach pasta andthrew it in the trash.....beyond flavorless, litteraly not even a suspicion of salt in the whole dish, sauce was watery and gross. We paid $9 for a Ceasar which consisted of lettuce with the worst knife cuts I've ever seen 1/16 cup of flaked cheese and half a hoagie bun that was toasted several hours ago and is now cold and soggy hacked up and tossed on top (reference picture.)  I worked my way through High School and College in multiple different Italian resturants, and belive me when I tell you this shit would not fly.  Had high hopes for this establishment, we will never be going back there again.  This place is for late night drunks who don't know any better.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Note that I came back in late January (I'm just now getting around to writing about it)...I always get skeptical on new hipster like restaurants that serve pho. Though the owner is Vietnamese, it's not the typical authentic pho restaurant where the servers barely speak any English and you have plastic menus. I was referred by a fellow foodie coworker so I was tempted to finally try this place out. It's kind of blended into the surrounded neighborhood being that it's pretty much a small, one story house that you're walking into. Gps will be your best friend...and looking for the sign! You walk in and it's very clean and updated. Not too many tables but luckily I came when it wasn't as busy. I decided to try the mushroom and tofu pho with vegan broth and I was surprised at how good it was. I'm not vegan so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Aside from adding more lime and hot sauce, it didn't really need much else. To end our night, we got the avocado smoothie that had both avocado and condensed milk. It was a refreshing way to cap the night off.Staff were all super friendly. I like the open kitchen look as well.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I only had the Pho at Vui's. I've been craving for a really good bone broth pho for a while, now that I've moved to the Midwest. My friends and I came here based on reviews and I am so shocked at how high the ratings are. The Pho was a disappointment. The broth had NO DEPTH whatsoever. The bowl came already dressed with cilantro, basil, bean sprouts, and jalapeños. That's not how Pho is served usually; you should be able to dictate how much or little of the herbs you want (come on a separate dish). The meal was way overpriced for what it was. Don't expect authentic Pho here. The 2 stars are for the awesome and quick service. I did love the ambience! Clean and vibrant.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Meh. 3 stars because the decor and location is nice. The pho looks great but it just doesn't have that flavor. It's really just noodles and a couple pieces of the beef. Which is fine, but not filling. I grew up on a Laos - Vietnamese styled pho and while I think there's potential, this is not authentic. There's only one size the pho and the veggies come on it (unlike authentic places). Remember to let them know when ordering if you don't care for any of the veggies. There is about 3 or 4 slices of beef, no meatballs, seafood or anything else that would normally be considered authentic. The bowl of pho is $10.95, pricey for what you get. Especially for one size. I do love their coffee though!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "For all my upcoming complaints, Vui's Kitchen does serve good food. My main problem is that it is priced like its going to be the best Vietnamese I've ever had. I ordered the tofu Banh mi w/o mayo for 9$, and while it was a decent size I found it pretty light on anything but the tofu patty which ended up making a lot of bites a bit bland. Half of the usual cilantro (which is my favorite part) was replaced with arugula.My friend had the Pho which I got to try; it had the right flavor, pretty good. However, there didn't seem to be much there hiding under the broth which is astounding for an 11$ Pho. Additionally all of the ingredients were served already placed in the broth, which seemed a bit odd to me.After all that, I still think the food here at Vui's Kitchen is good. But it's hard not to nitpick with the hit to the wallet.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Not the best I've had but definitely good. I ordered the banh mi with pork belly as well for a to-go order. I can't say enough times how good the pork belly was. I decided against the spring rolls because it's something I can make super cheap at home and the markup was insane. I think 6.95 if I recall correctly. The banh mi was quite expensive as well in comparison to many places, but I'd say it's worth it. I think it was $10 or so. The average place I order them in Nashville is $3.75-$6. My boyfriend loved this place as well. He said if he came back he'd order the banh mi. I would probably do the noodle bowl. And yes, I'd definitely come back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "3.5 stars! I've been on the fence about trying Vui's due to the mixed reviews. But my husband wanted pho and we were in the area so we decided to judge for ourselves. The parking is a bit weird, there's a bit of gravel parking, but mostly street parking. The restaurant itself is small, but really cute. Maybe seats 30, including patio. The menu is very limited, they kept it very simple. One type of pho, one type of rice dish, etc. You order at the cashier and the food is brought to you. We each ordered a pho, fresh coconut, and shared a pork belly banh mi. Didn't take long for the food to come out. The pho was served with the veggies already on it, so if you don't like bean sprouts, cilantro, onions, be sure to request them off. It comes with thinly sliced beef and that's it. No meatballs, no brisket, seafood. The broth was different, it wasn't bad, but not what I'm used to. But it did have a depth to it. Since we shared the pork belly banh mi, I believe I got the more fatty piece of meat. It was just ok, I didn't care for the arugula and probably preferred cilantro. If you're used to venturing to authentic vietnamese restaurants such as Miss Saigon, Kien Yang, then Vui's won't appeal to you. You won't have 12 different types of pho. It's a healthy take on traditional vietnamese cuisine. And I would say they do a pretty good job at it.  I just prefer the traditional flavors and takes of vietnamese food. The service was great, everyone was nice and courteous.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Vui's Kitchen was a whole new experience, in this regard. The atmosphere is bright, clean, and modern. You order at the counter and pay on an iPad, giving it almost a juice bar type vibe. Seating inside is limited, but they also have a covered outdoor seating area with heat lamps. The staff are also very friendly. My only complaint would be that the atmosphere is a less authentic than you would have at your normal, family-owned Vietnamese restaurant (though, I have no idea who owns Vui's Kitchen, so it very well could be a Vietnamese family). The summer rolls are refreshing, but certainly not enough to fill you up. I also had the Banh Mi sandwich with pork belly, which I thought was delicious. It can be messy to eat, so I don't necessarily suggest it on a first date, though!Overall, this is a great place for those who have not had Vietnamese before and need a place to try out the flavors.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was originally going to give it only 3 stars, perhaps I'm a Vietnamese and know how authentic Vietnamese food should taste. But overall, this new restaurant is a nice place.-Service: 4/5. Staff are friendly. Food came out pretty slow but it was during their grand opening and they were busy. The owner came out and chatted with us several times. - Ambience and interior design: 4/5 the restaurant is small but I love their style. On the walls they hang iconographics of different items on the menu with their ingredients and Vietnamese names. The color scheme is very nice. I like their spoons because they are the exact ones I used at home lol. Also, you can see the kitchen and observe them making food through the order counter. - Price: 2.5/5 Ehhh really 9 bucks for a sandwich? And 8 bucks for a small bow of beef salad is really pricey for this kind of restaurant. I could easily find a better place with more reasonable price. Their portion of the Pho is also smaller than most Vietnamese places I have been to.- Food: 3/5. Our group ordered beef pho, beef salad, lemongrass pork banh my, sugarcane juice, and avocado smoothie. I was really disappointed at the sandwich. It was cold, the bread wasn't cripsy, and the meat was too fatty. But more important, I didn't feel the flavors of different ingredients were blended together. It was instead like eating different dishes at the same time. The pho was decent. My friends said the beef was tender but the broth was plain and its sweetness came more from sugar than from simmering bones. For Pho, broth is extremely important and it decides whether you sucessfully cook it. The avocado smoothie tasted very wholesome and rich, but not very sweet. I also like the sugarcane juice and feel so glad to finally find some place that has it here.Updated: I went there for the second time today with a Vietnamese friend. We got spring rolls, pho, and bun thit nuong. Not recommend the rolls. There were too much vegetables and too little noodle. But the pho and bun are decent. Much faster service this time.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Vui's of course spells it right on their menu, but many people/Yelpers still think it's \"bahn.\" No. It's B-A-N-H. Okay now that I'm done educating, I'm pretty impressed that Viet food has become somewhat hip and trendy in Nashville!Coming from California, any bowl of pho that costs over $8 is overpriced, but hey, this is The South, AND it's East Nashville, so I get it. I'll pay the extra $2 for pho. As long as it's not over $10...Vui's is definitely a cute restaurant. I love how the menu has all items written and listed in Vietnamese as well as English, which makes it feel authentic, even though I rarely see any actual Viets eating here. Now onto the food. I normally get the BUN bowl -- noodles with lemongrass pork. The pork is pho-king delicious!! So flavorful and tender, with just enough fat. The greens and veggies in the dish taste fresh and clean. My husband likes the COM rice bowl. He personally prefers more meat (they only give you two pieces), but it's enough for me. I'm 100 lbs though so I don't need as much protein. Anyway I can't wait to return and taste the rest of the menu, which offers a pretty good selection. Try drinking one of the common and authentic Viet drinks like a fresh coconut, nuoc mia (sugarcane) or an avocado smoothie. Avocados aren't just for guacamole or salads!

Once we confirmed they offered vegetarian items, we were undoubtedly going.I opted for the bun aka noodle bowl, which includes vermicelli noodles, romaine, arugula, fresh herbs, carrots, cucumbers, pickled daikon and carrots, peanuts, fried shallots, and scallion. I opted for the lemongrass tofu vegetarian option so skipped the fish sauce dressing. I told my boyfriend it was like an unwrapped spring roll. It was a perfect lunch option - healthy, filling, and giving you a boost for the rest of the day. My boyfriend opted for the pho, which has a twelve-hour bone broth. It includes white onion, scallion, cilantro, Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime, and rice noodles. He went with the tender beef slices protein. Again, this was very clean tasting and a most generous portion.

    "comments": "What a great addition to the area. We come by here every so often to visit the cats at the Cat Shoppe right down the street. I cannot remember what was once in this location, but they've remodeled & popped in a fresh and fast Vietnamese restaurant. I was lucky enough to be a guest during the soft open & was impressed with not only the flavor, but the freshness of the ingredients. Located at the corner of Bransford Avenue & Heather place, right near Thompson lane, you'll find this little gem. They're added a patio to the front & back of what once was a home (many moons ago). The owners also own Juice Bar which is located right next door. The menu has Vietnamese staples and enough options to not make you feel overwhelmed. I picked the Còm (rice bowl) which consisted of Jasmine brown rice with romain, arugula, cucumber, picked diakon & carrots, fresh herbs, shallots, scallion oil and Vui's dressing ($8.95). You're able to pick which protein you want, & I picked the five spice shrimp (+2).The service was friendly & the food came out quickly. We also tried some of the summer rolls which were great, & the lotus salad. Everything here just tastes like it was picked out of the garden. On the walk up to the front, they've got raised boxes for planting, no doubt they'll get a lot of use this year. The decor is fun & hip. I like the color scheme & the IKEA type light fixtures. My only qualm about inside is that the dining area is a little cramped. If everyone is seated, it's hard to get out or maneuver around. I guess this is why they've got some seating on the front porch & the back covered porch. The rice bowl is a good portion for the price. I love brown rice, but I know some think that it can be chewy, this wasn't the case. The sauce that came with the bowl was sweet & spicy. I put a little of the heat from the sauce on the table in the bowl as well. For the 2 dollar up charge, you get 5 nice sized shrimp that I cut up into ten pieces. For my drink I got the ginger lemonade ($3.95), & like the rest of the meal, it was refreshing & tasty. They've got a coconut pudding that looked near but I was stuffed & didn't try it.

    "comments": "I went to Vui's for lunch yesterday, and I was impressed by their light, healthy, and simple take on Vietnamese. My mom (who is vegan) got the vegan pho, which she loved. I got the rice bowl with tofu, which was quite delicious. They have a lot of options (including for vegetarians and vegans) - most of their dishes are made with your choice of beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu. Vui's is quite small, so it can get busy (and don't even get me started on the parking!), so we went at off hours (even at almost 3:00 in the afternoon on a weekday, there were many tables taken inside. Luckily, it was a beautiful day, and they have a charming back patio (as well as a front patio with one or two tables), that is covered and has 5 or 6 tables. We ordered at the counter and sat out on the back patio, which was relaxing and so quiet. I'm sure I'll be back and maybe next time I'll try the shrimp!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Before I ordered, however, I called them to make sure that the items can be made vegetarian and without mushrooms.  They assured me they could.  Despite  being very clear on the order, EVERY SINGLE DISH HAD MEAT, SEAFOOD, OR MUSHROOMS.   I called them and they are going to remake and redeliver the items, but I have zero tolerance for these kinds of mistakes.  It can happen once, sure, but on every single dish?  Vegetarians have to trust the restaurant to make items meat-free, and, clearly, this restaurant can not be trusted.   AND:  when they redelivered the order, they forgot to include the sauce for every dish.  I will never ever go there or order from them again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So, admittedly, I am not a Vietnamese food expert.  I have eaten at several such restaurants, though, and I know I do not care for a lot of Cilantro.  My wife had heard great things about this place from a co-worker, and we decided to meet there for lunch, today.  We arrived right at 11a or a few minutes after, as we knew it got packed quickly.  The place is small and cozy, and the parking seems even smaller and cozier.  Ha ha!  My wife decided on the summer rolls and the cabbage and chicken salad.  We upgraded her salad to a large, and I added the Bahn Mi (spelling?! - sorry) with pork belly, as recommended by the cashier.  He was very helpful.  He noted that I did not want Cilantro on the sandwich for me - thank you!  He also suggested the fish sauce for me for the salad as I prefer not to have sweet / fruity dressings with my salad.  Our summer rolls arrived at our table, first.  The food seemed fresh and had a good presentation (see pics).  I will say, for the price, I've had rolls with a lot more shrimp, but these were still good.  The peanut sauce was a little less sweet than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise for me.  The salad and sandwich arrived, shortly thereafter.  Both were presented well.  The sandwich had a lot of veggies in it (falling out of the sandwich), although I was a little surprised there was no side with it, for the price.  To be fair, it was a pretty large sandwich stuffed full.  The salad was a large salad and tasted very good, as well, although it also was surprisingly light on the chicken.  However, some places will charge a couple dollars more to even get chicken, so it wasn't too bad on price.  All in, we spent $27 with only waters to drink.  That's a little steeper than we would normally get for a place that really does not offer wait service.  I expect we will go back, again, as they have good food with a lot of healthy options, and it is a good location for my wife and I to meet, during the day.One minor thing that I did want to add, is that their gravel parking lot may leave you standing in a puddle of water if it is raining.  I had to work pretty hard not to get my shoes / socks soaked...\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

(On the inside- the small outside means parking can be Tight) You walk in and order your meal, pay and sit down. Overall all the servings were smaller than we are accustomed to and the pho comes \"complete\" meaning everything is in the bowl already then being on a separate plate for adding as you deem fit. It also didn't come out quite as hot  (temp)as I like it. It was tasty though and I must sure we will be back when we decide to take a break from our favorite again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I mean they literally put the basil, bean sprouts, jalapeños in for you... you don't know how much basil I want or can handle...I like the ambience although I find the place rather small (it also got pretty full really quickly. There's barely any space between the chairs so good luck not bumping into someone as they're eating.)The service is great. They're very attentive, polite and quick. The portions are small, so don't come hungry. The actual pho is a little too dark for my liking and a little bland. But that could be cuz someone else garnished it instead of me. It's not bad pho. It's just not worth the $11 they're charging you. Would I go back again? Eh prob not unless the other pho places are closed ... like today.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ordered take out last week for a few people at work and had to fight to get parking since I went in during peak hours. It's definitely small inside, and I was very glad that I didn't have to fight to get a seat! I had the noodle bowl with the shrimp, and everything was very fresh and flavorful and a large portion! I like spicy food and got some chili sauce to go. The portion was tiny, and I had to fill up my container from one of the tables because I like a lot of heat! I agree with other reviewers that it is more expensive than my favorite Vietnamese options off Charlotte, but I love the freshness of Vui's and am going to be back again! I am excited to try more of the menu.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Before our evening movie at Regal, we stopped in for a quick bite to eat. I think Anna S. summed it best in her review.... If you are trying to compare this place to the authentic Miss Saigon, Kien Giang, you are going to be disappointed. This place has potential and is a great addition to the Nashville scene but I won't be back in the foreseeable future.Our whole party each ordered the pho. It came in a large bowl with broth, all the ingredients inside. Thankfully, I didn't think it was full of sodium as I didn't feel bloated after my meal. However, there was minimal flavor to the broth that I added tons of Sriracha and Hoisin sauce. There was some sliced beef but not enough to compliment the amount of noodles.Seating: Tables are tightly packed in so if you've got a coat or backpack, it can be difficult to navigate the tables but everyone is friendly and willing to help you out.... feels like Southern hospitality.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

What I love most about Viu's, is that I can season it effortlessly. Sriracha, Hoison, and lime. I can't do that anywhere else. They put the perfect amount of vegetables. (Bean sprouts, basil, etc.) It makes pho so simple. I also never feel tired or experience a \"pho buzz\" after leaving here, lol. I think that may have something to do with the \"no msg added\" twist. I rated it 4 stars because it is very small and very limited in parking. It is very cramped and is almost impossible to get in during lunch and dinner. I would never come unless I was alone or with one other person. I have only been lucky after 2pm and before 6pm. Other than that, I love the cleanliness and simplicity of the place. I would definitely return!\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Absolutely spectacular! I cannot say enough good things about this place, I've been waiting three months to go after I saw it across from Baja Burrito but it was absolutely worth the wait and -- they have now have got a weekly customer for life. I shall call it \"Vui's Cure for the Monday Blues.\"Yes, I did go on Tuesday but I mean... next week. ANYWAYS! As usual when I'm too excited to order I ask the cashier/waiter to help me figure it out. I wanted to get the Banh Mi - everyone and their mom says it's the best in the city - but I wanted to cut out the bread (mama is going to Puerto Rico in a week - can't be having a carb belly bump). The cashier (you order at the counter) told me I could basically have a custom Banh Mi Bowl with noodles - I don't know if that's just normal but it did make me feel special. I got that bowl, and herbal tea (made in house!) and sat down with my friend. The atmosphere was cool, calming and very clean. Oh! And smiles all around from the delicious food I was about to undoubtedly devour. The food came out in about 10 minutes and I am so sad I didn't take any pictures! I was greeted with a beautiful display of the fresh veggies, the AMAZING looking marinated lemon grass chicken and little dishes to put on my noodle bowl. All for about $13.00. I would eat that meal for the rest of my life - the enigmatic flavors, the look and the ridiculously courteous and knowledge staff makes this place my new favorite.Way to go, Berry Hill. Way to go!

    "comments": "I honestly want to give this restaurant a 3.5... But I don't have that option. * warning, mixed reviewI'll start off with service. The staff is exceptionally great! Very helpful, friendly, and patient. I unexpectedly took a little bit to order not knowing that before you sit you must order and pay first. So I was totally unprepared thinking that we would be seated first. They were very kind and attentive to helping me decide on what dish and beverage to order. You get a number for your table after your order is placed. You are free to pick and choose where ever you'd like to sit. The food did not take long at all to arrive. It came as a surprise because we came in on a full house so getting are food on time was great! The tea was self serve, that was pretty neat. Overall service was a 5 star for me.The food..I've grown up with authentic Asian food, especially authentic Vietnamese, being a portion Vietnamese, I know good viet food! I will say the food isn't terrible.I ordered the pho. It was a little under decent for my taste. The broth tasted watered down. Very few meat slices. The noodles weren't bad. Overall this wasn't really a pho bowl, not an authentic one anyway. It's hard to explain especially if you are Vietnamese and grew up eating this dish from not one but many many mom, aunts, and grandmas that make homemade pho. Coming from a health nut, it was a good bowl. But also, pho bowls aren't necessarily unhealthy so to alter the traditional taste wasn't really needed.The avocado smoothie, hands down, delicious.I ordered the banh mi for to go, I actually really enjoyed it, had its own type of twist. Maybe a little more Americanized, but I liked it! Over priced for a banh mi to be honest..... My family use to own a Vietnamese restaurant, so that price was ridiculous. But hey, it was good, I liked it. Overall great service, okay- to good food. I would definitely come back, I honestly wouldn't order the pho again. But I look forward to trying the rest of the menu. I highly recommend this place to people that haven't tried viet nor Asian food simply because the tastes aren't over powering for new comers.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I really wanted to love this place, but fell a bit flat for me. I ordered the Bahn Mi based on recommendation of gentleman who took my order. (Alternative was Pho). I suppose a big reason why I didn't enjoy the sandwich all that much was the texture of the chicken. I believe it was a mixture of white and dark meat which made it a bit on the softer/chewier side... hard to describe the texture other than I didn't care for it. I am not a fan of dark meat chicken overall, so could have been my mistake not to ask ahead of time. I just took for granted most fast casual / fresh cafes tend to use all white meat chicken; so again, had I known upfront, may have had a different experience. I did enjoy the grilled taste of the bread and the fresh veggies. on the sandwich. The spring rolls were also very fresh and I enjoyed them. Not sure what the bill total was, I was eating with a coworker and he cashed us out, but many of my friends had said it was a bit pricey. Looking back on the menu, it looks like to add meat to the base sandwich $8.95 sandwich is another $2. The atmosphere was clean and bright.  I likely won't be rushing back. I would only order Pho and have a go to spot for that in town.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

One person got the bahn mi which was lemongrass pork and so delicious. The pork pho which was unbelievable had to be split between three diners to be finished. We also got an avocado smoothie, which we have never had before anywhere. It was velvety smooth and lightly sweet, very refreshing! Another part of dessert was a tasty coconut pudding with chia seeds. We were given a friendly greeting by John, who is Vui's husband, and made to feel right at home. Armand was super-courteous in taking our order and making sure all of our needs were met. We will most certainly be back! Cannot recommend highly enough.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Going to apologize, up front, for loyal patrons of this place.  While we do not necessarily need 'qualifications' for the reviews we choose to leave, I (personally) would feel hypocritical writing about the authenticity of an establishment's food without at least having a very solid bank of experience on which to base observations.  That being said, my in-laws were born and RAISED in Vietnam.  My husband grew up eating almost nothing but authentic Vietnamese meals that were traditionally prepared from generations old 'recipes'.  For the last twenty years, I've also enjoyed the wonderful meals from my MIL's kitchen. Our 6 and 8 year olds less than 20 years, but with obvious reason.  Either way, that's the background on which the following review is based.  Summer Rolls delivered much less than expected.  There were no rice stick noodles at all, nearly all lettuce, and only half of the full roll had a slice of shrimp.  The peanut sauce also had some other ingredient in it (maybe Rice Vinegar??) that made it taste quite off.  It tasted mostly of hoisin, water, and something vinegar-y.  There might have been a touch of peanut butter but it was indiscernible in relation to the other stuff. The Bun with Lemongrass Chicken didn't taste like Lemongrass Chicken at all.  It had the same sauce all over it as was served with the Summer Rolls.The kids noodle bowl, also with Lemongrass Chicken, was much the same but was served with a small dish of straight soy sauce.  Not sure any kid knows just how salty soy sauce is, but would recommend that parents taste it first before assuming it is some other sort of sauce.  It's definitely not nuoc mam.   The Banh Mi had a very similar tasting (peanut?) sauce all over it and was a mess to eat.  The Pho (Tai) had so much ginger that the smell alone should have told us all we needed to know.  There was no depth of flavor, no rich beefiness, nothing other than what could, at best, be ginger tea. It was not served warm enough to even heat the meat, nor was it served with any of the accoutrements like basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, etc...  Nobody in our family felt our meal was anywhere close to authentic.  It was also grossly overpriced (i.e. kids Pho only had broth and noodles - the side of meat cost more than the actual kids meal).  The person that took our order also must not have heard our full order as a few things that were ordered did not make it out to our table.  When we asked about the items we were told that they weren't included on the order and that we would have to wait in line again to order them and pay for them.  Additionally, she must also not have heard the two requests that were made to leave the crushed peanuts on the side of the Bun we ordered. Parking was also a wreck waiting to happen.  While I would not recommended this place to anybody at all, I must give credit where credit is due.  The beef in the Pho was tender and seemed of good quality and the French bread used for the Banh Mi was very good.  Additionally, the atmosphere was decent and the waitress that brought us our food was very nice and was also very attentive.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We also ordered the Banh Mi with tofu, I'm a traditionalist when it comes to my Banh Mi-it was good, had the right amount of vegetables to pate, not a fan of the bread that it came in-but it didn't stop me from eating the whole thing!

    "comments": "Really enjoyed my first trip to Vui's at the end of the lunch rush (1ish) on a Saturday. The space is a bit small, and standing in a line of more than 3 people backs you into the entrance, but they do a decent job of moving folks along. I'd say it'd be worth adding another POS to help, but the space is definitely too small for that. Any pains with ordering aside, the food was delicious. My wife enjoyed her rice bowl with lemongrass chicken, and my banh mi was awfully tasty, if not the most traditional one I've had. I'll definitely be back to try the summer rolls and noodle bowl.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I heard my friends rave about how good this place is for several months now and was looking forward to having another place to have pho.  I would say I am a highly proficient pho eater having grown up eating it all of my life.  So, in my humble opinion, I know a good bowl of pho when I'm eating it, and I usually judge a Vietnamese restaurant by how good its pho is.  I'm sorry to say that the pho at Vui's is the worst I've had in the city.  Maybe it suits other people's taste but ... blah.The broth was too sweet (the worst), had only one type of meat, and the broth lacked any depth.  It actually tasted more mushroomy than beefy.  I would expect something like this if someone requested vegetarian pho.  My friend had the banh mi and she enjoyed it, although it wasn't a traditional banh mi with its ingredients.  We also shared a goi cuon (summer roll), which was more noodles than anything.  To top it off, all of it was really expensive.  $11 for a small bowl of pho?!!  The ambience is all very nice, which I think is the real contributor to its overly inflated ratings, alongside a whole lot of people who are not in search of good, authentic Vietnamese food.  I should add that the service is not table side but was very friendly and efficient.  Maybe I should think of it as Vietnamese fusion, but definitely not traditional.  Regardless, this is just another watered down, hipstered restaurant.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Vui's is delightful! Still a significant lunch line around 2p on Saturday, but our food came out in about 10-15 minutes. It's a petite place; despite the crowd, we were able to get a table no problem. Really cute/fresh branding- could totally see it being franchised!Order and pay first style establishment, so you can leave whenever you're done.We went for the Chicken & Cabbage Salad, Pork Banh Mi, and Chicken Rice Bowl.The Banh Mi was off the chains! The French bread was so soft with just the right amount of interior toasting, significant portion of protein like I've never gotten on Banh mi, and delicious flavoring in the condiments and garnishes. Highly recommend.The rice bowl was a refreshing dish and the chicken was spot on - so tender and moist! Great for a lunch dish.The chicken & cabbage salad was not my favorite, but others loved it! The coriander was maybe too much for me. A lot of green in there with the shredded chicken.Will definitely be back and probably will be doing takeout here, too. Fairly standard prices for local establishment fast fresh style dining. Absolutely worth checking out.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Over rated. Good marketing. Cool place but if you are looking for authentic pho they don't have it. And for whatever they called pho it is overpriced. Saw this place on a magazine and as a huge pho lover I can not pass it. I really thought they offer authentic pho because they claim they cook their broth for 12 hours. But no.... The pho broth is very very plain. I cook pho at home with no msg etc and I got better result with cooking only 3 hrs. Only one kind of meat was in the bowl and not much in it. They do not put all the herb on the side which is a little disturbing. You can get rich flavored, more authentic pho for almost half of the price in Other Vietnamese restaurants in Nashville. I had better pho even at Thai restaurants... Cool place to try out if you don't care about authenticity of the food. I am sure if you never tried pho and love noodles you will probably enjoy this place. I do like restaurants that pay first and self serve. It just makes everything easier.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was feeling slightly under the weather and didn't feel like driving all the way to west Nashville to get my fix of pho, so I decided to stop by Vui's Kitchen for some soup to soothe my aching throat! Pulling up to the restaurant was already slightly difficult. I absolutely love the decor of VK, but the graveled parking lot, the messiness of where/how to park, the dimly lit area made it very difficult to even enter the restaurant. But when you finally do make your way towards the front, it's super cute! I love love love how modern the interior was - the patio seating was lit by Christmas lights (my ultimate weakness) and the music was softly playing in the background. When you go up the wooden walkway, you're immediately greeted by the smell of pho, which got me really excited. The menu is to your left, and unlike most pho restaurants, you order and pay first. They have pre-made avocado shakes & coconut treats!! I thought that was definitely a nice touch. I didn't like how cramped the space was - all the tables were pressed up against each other, but it was promising how many people were eating there on a Thursday night. I got the pho with beef slices and my friend got the Vietnamese iced coffee. The pho was SUPER bland. Zero flavor. I had to keep adding Sriracha & hoison sauce just to get any sort of flavor. Also... no meat balls? Odd. I also didn't like how they added the extra veggies in for me - I'm used to getting a plate of veggies and choosing how much/what I wanted to put in. I liked how the broth wasn't oily - but then again, I'd take an oily flavorful broth over a broth with zero flavor. I also tried my friend's coffee - it was much sweeter & creamier than Vietnamese coffee is supposed to be. The prices also were relatively pricey for the quality you got; I paid around $11 for a bowl of pho, and my friend's coffee was around $5. It's really not worth getting your car stuck in gravel & eating in a cramped space.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It had all the right favors and the amount of sauce they give you is just right. The only suggestion I would make is to cut the pork belly into bite-size pieces; I was given two large slabs of pork belly and it was a bit awkward to eat with just chopsticks. The coconut pudding is also a great way to end the meal; it wasn't too sweet and was equally as delicious. Just keep an eye on the tablet that what you want is actually keyed in. We ordered the spring rolls and they did not make it onto the ticket. Other than that every thing is great!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Fresh Vietnamese and not traditional for sure. Portions are a healthy serving size but expect to have no leftovers as is common with normal restaurant serving sizes. I can tell they want to give a gourmet touch despite the order at the cashier set up, but the price isn't worth it. Plus I asked for jalapeños on my noodles it wasn't there. Never theless my noodle bowl was very yummy with the vegan dressing ( that's where the magic was) and the lemon grass tofu was one of the best tofu I have had in a while. Friend got chicken rice bowl. They said it was decent and tasty. Either way, the price is definitely a bit higher than anyone would've liked.

A Bahn Mi sandwich for $10...I guess I'm spoiled living in the Chicago area where we are able to get it for $3- $4. $11 for what seems like a medium sized bowl of pho. The bowls are large but the portion size is not. I didn't like that the condiments like basil, jalapeños, bean sprouts etc were already put in. Also the temperature of the pho wasn't as hot as we're use to. BUT I will say that the broth is very good. My family and I cleaned all of our bowls.

Everything is very attractive--the dining room, the food, the dishes, the staff...and attractiveness (or cuteness, cleverness, hipness, sexiness, trendiness, etc.) seems to be a very important feature of new Nashville restaurants these days. That's great. I'm not opposed to attractive. I like attractive.But I like good food more.I love Vietnamese food for its bold, fresh, complex flavors that are well balanced in each dish. While the food at Viu's is definitely fresh--it is certainly not bold or particularly balanced--at least not the dishes my lunch companion and I had (noodle bowl with shrimp; lotus root salad). They were both very tame, bland affairs.I will say in both dishes the shrimp were cooked perfectly, no small feat.OH, and a note to all recent Nashville emigre restaurateurs: You don't open a restaurant in the South and NOT offer real brewed iced tea. It's just obnoxious. And to be clear, fruit tea and flavored teas DO NOT COUNT!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Come with your bestie; visit with your sweetie; drop by in a party of four. No more.All joking aside: you really can't go wrong on the brief, focused menu. The spring rolls are a marvel of taste and texture. The rice bowls, noodle bowls, and pho are all superb. The pressed sugarcane juice seems a little expensive, but once you're as addicted as I am, you'll get it every time. The employees are consistently helpful and friendly.

The quaint little house in Berryhill has slowly turned into a full-fledged restaurant and I finally found myself inside.Needless to say, I went a little crazy.I sampled the summer rolls, lemongrass chicken vermicelli bowl, chicken Banh-mi, avocado smoothie, and also the iced coffee. The food was fresh, tasty, filling, and everything I wanted. The chicken was fantastic and I would be hard pressed to get another meat, though they all sound tasty. The interior has some awesome posters depicting all the ingredients in their food. As an avid cook, I enjoyed the cross sectional analysis of every component in their Banh mi, pho, etc. I wish they had that when you order at the front so you can get the full view of the menu. I think the best aspect was the extremely attentive and accommodating service. Normally fast casual places aren't meant to have much in the way of service, at least in my experience. Vui's has some friendly and welcoming staff that seemed genuinely appreciative we were there dining.I'd return for the food alone, but the service bumps them to a full 5 stars. Definitely sample it if you get the chance. It's worth supporting a new restaurant doing all the things right.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I don't know much about Vietnamese food but am always up to try anything. I got the pork bahn mi and was absolutely not disappointed. Super flavorful, had the best texture to it and amazingly fresh. I'm already plotting my next visit. There was a salad I was going between, so I'll try that next. The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because the tables on the patio are used wire wheels, which props to them for reusing, reducing and recyclying, but the one we were at was so low, we were having to awkwardly bend over our plates. This definitely did not aid in my digestion.Very friendly staff and though there was a long line for lunch, our meal did not take a long time to come to us!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

During my short wait, they brought out a complementary appetizer for our table for the \"inconvenience\" which was thoughtful and generous. The pho was very tasty, though not quite to the top of the stack compared to two other restaurants. For being this dialed in during their second week, I'm still impressed and have no doubt their food will move from a 4 to a 5 stars this summer.

I don't think it truly deserves 4 stars right now (our service was hella slow) but apparently it just opened, so I'll assume they get those kinks ironed out soon. I had the noodle bowl. It wasn't the tastiest dish I've ever had, but I have to believe it's because they don't put a lot of \"extras\" in their dishes. They stress that they don't put additives or preservatives or anything in their food, and to their credit, the dish tasted straight out of the garden. I would consider going back and trying something else, but I'm not dying to.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been to Vui's seven or eight times now, and somehow, my tastebuds still aren't satisfied.Pros: Very, very clean. From the prep area (right behind the ordering counter) to the bathrooms to the small dining porch, everything is spotless.Most of the food is wonderful. From what I understand, the owner prepares the pork herself, and let me tell you, the banh minh sandwich couldn't be improved. Spring rolls are fresh, pretty basic, but very very tasty. Get them with the fish sauce instead of peanut sauce if you want a real treat.The noodles with shrimp use real, plump, juicy shrimp - not those cheap tiny ones Miss Saigon has been using, and not the cheap dehydrated-then-fattened-with-who-knows-what-injected places like Kien Giang have been using. No, these are real shrimp, cooked just enough to be tasty.The lotus salad is unusual, especially in Nashville, and delicious. (Though unlike most of the food, it isn't just as good the next day. Eat it all here.)Decor is pleasant and unassuming. There are wonderful posters on the walls showing what ingredients go into each item as well.Vegetarian options abound - we haven't found anything that couldn't substitute tofu or more vegetables for meat or poultry.Cons: I hate to say it, but the pho is really substandard. I've eaten pho all over the United States, as well as several Asian countries, and this is not it. I was very very excited to try it, because my wife has problems with MSG, and so far as we've been able to discover, this is the only Vietnamese restaurant in Nashville that doesn't use it. But the pho just doesn't cut it. The boldness of Vietnamese flavors is missing. We've tried the steak pho (meat was okay, pretty tough, pieces quite thick), and the vegetarian pho (mushroom base, way way too mushroom-y for either of us). I wish they'd do a plain chicken pho, the kind you can buy for breakfast all over Viet Nam. Other con: The music. I'm sorry, but in a music town, playing below-average thrasher or metal music, or even heavy rock, at volumes that preclude table talk, is just not good. I was actually pretty surprised by the choice of music. To me, Vui's should be playing something classical, and playing it so quietly that I'd have to strain to make it out.I've read a number of reviews that complained about the price. To me, paying $8.95 for an incredible sandwich with highest grade pork, no artificial anything, and super-fresh vegetables is just fine. My only quarrel with the banh minh is the bread, advertised as \"baguette\" but in reality a very soft long bun. Baguettes traditionally have crunchy crusts. This restaurant could take a lesson in that from our other favorite Vietnamese in town, Interasian Market, whose baguettes are as close to French bread as I've had in the States.So, with the caveat that the pho could really use some help, I'd give this a high recommend.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was having dinner with a friend and felt like I was having a conversation with a few tables around me. I would have loved to have gotten up for more tea, but I didn't feel like clearing other tables as I passed.  We ordered spring rolls, the beef pho, the chicken Bahn Mi, and the chicken salad.The spring rolls were room temperature and, without the peanut sauce, really just tasted like the basil and mint.I like my Pho to come with the \"accessories\" on the side, so it was disappointing when it all came in the same bowl.  It was lukewarm and overpowered by the basil and mint.  The broth was just ok, and the noodles were a big glob in the middle of it all.  Usually there are bamboo shoots for some crunch, but not in my bowl.The chicken Bahn Mi was very good, but I would have liked he bread crispy, as other have stated.The chicken salad was fresh and crispy and everything I wanted it to be.There were many young families there that night, and kids were having fun, as kids do....and it's a small place, Nobody was rowdy, but it's not the place to go for a quiet dinner with your Kindle or to have \"catch-up\" dinner with a friend.I will go again, but will get my food to go.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I went in on the opening day, and it was very very crowded for the lunch rush. However, they didn't miss a beat and brought out our food quickly. I was a little underwhelmed by the Summer Rolls, but my friend really loved the Lotus Root Salad. We both thought that the Avocado Shake was really unique and very flavorful. If you go, you have to try the homemade condiments that are on the table. They provided a delicious and authentic kick to the meal. We saw the size of the Big Bites meals and decided to go with the Small Bites, but they were a lot smaller than we'd expected, especially for the high price. I definitely want to buy one of the larger dishes when I return. But for a new restaurant that I'm sure is still finding it's footing, they're doing a great job.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our friends had burritos which were huge, fresh and tasty.No liquor license but folks seemed to be byob, no fountain drinks, no diet drinks.  Very casual place, but I'm pretty sure there was a model or actress at the next table.  Place was full but not crowded, majority of patrons seemed pretty upscale but relaxed.

While it's not written down, each of the menu items can come with either spicy pork, steak, chicken, tongue, beans or cheese (and probably some others..). We got two tacos (tongue and spicy pork), a cheese quesadilla with beans, a tlayudo (like a Mexican pizza, flour tortilla, thin slices of cabbage, frijoles, cheese, steak, fresh tomato and avocado), and chicken flautas. With 4 drinks, it was $30. Really a bargain- big portions of very well prepared food. The place was clean and inviting, the kitchen open, and staff were friendly and took time to explain things.  They didn't have ceviche available at the time, but since it's Memorial Day weekend I appreciate that they might not have been able to get fresh fish and I would rather they not try and serve old raw fish.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Although it has tables and chairs like a restaurant, it is really more of a taco stand, the way it's set up. There are no paper menus, just a bunch of a la carte items written on painted plywood -- no combination plates with rice/beans, just the various items such as tacos, sopes, enchiladas, etc. Now, about the enchiladas, do NOT order them unless you love mole sauce, because they are drowning in it (and filled with chicken that's not that flavorful). I counted 4 enchiladas with a lot of corn tortilla dough underneath the mole sauce, which means unless you're extremely hungry, it's best shared with another person. I inquired afterwards and he says that's the only kind of enchiladas they make. I'm giving it 4 stars, but the tacos, adjusted for mid-TN, should be 5 stars, with the enchiladas a 3. I think they only take cash.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Noodles are an inexpensive but serious thing over there, I learned about it at a noodle shop that was on 48th off Lexington in New York (I was the only non-Japanese in the joint I think.) Well Nashville has a ramen shop now called Otaku, I will be going back if only to try another item on the menu that caught my attention.Parking was easy as there is a garage just to the left that offers free one hour parking and $3 for two hours. We were greeted immediately by the owner and taken to a table. Drinks arrived promptly however they don't carry a diet soda (?) Our dishes arrived shortly thereafter - I ordered the Spicy Miso which is sort of a Korean twist on traditional Japanese ramen. Why not be creative? It was spicy as advertised and delicious. My father ordered the Tennessee Tonkatsu which looked like a more traditional ramen, I will try that next time. The owner stopped by to do a table check, it's very obvious that she is a \"hands on\" manager. I found the concept a little curious because they had a bar next door that was accessible through a door in the restaurant. It was more spacious and didn't seem to have any focus on food. People were filling the place up however, could a Japanese small plate concept work insofar as the bar? I could easily go to a bar that had small amounts of nigiri or chirashi to go with the beverages. Just a thought.Try Otaku if you're in the mood for something different, it's affordably priced and they'll even give you a fork if you can't use chopsticks (sorry Dad.)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

So we decided to take a break on our weekend stay and venture out for some ramen.The vibe here is pretty cool. Open kitchen concept in the front, more intimate bar scene in the back (which opens up as a patio when it's nice out). Service was a tad slow and we did have to wait like 20 minutes for our table. Luckily, we were able to grab a drink at the back bar. It was a Saturday night so I understand it being busy, but this can't be anything new for the area.Now to be completely honest, it wasn't the best ramen I've ever had (I've had some pretty delicious Ramen back in Chicago), but it was pretty darn good. We started out with the duck buns and those were amazing. The duck just melted in your mouth and the flavor was powerful.For my ramen entree I chose the spicy miso. This bowl included pork bone broth with miso and korean chili, ground pork, kimchi, menma, bean sprouts, scallion, and an egg. The spice level was right on par. Nothing unbearable, but it had a nice kick which I like.Overall a nice trendy little spot in the area to grab some ramen!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The key to a legit ramen is the broth. All of the add-ins are important to complete the dish but without a solid broth, you have nothing. Otaku has got it going on! We started with the duck buns which were fantastic. The buns were nice and fluffy and steamed to perfection. The duck was tender and succulent, exactly how it should be! I could eat those for a whole meal!Both my friend and I ordered the Tennessee Tonkatsu. I really really enjoyed it! The broth is flavorful, rich, and smokey. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The pork was very innovative. I've never seen pork in ramen cooked with this method and I absolutely loved it. The pork is cooked confit. And then pressed onto the grill into a patty. Yum. The egg was also cooked well!! I highly recommend this ramen place. Service was friendly and I will definitely come back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Similar to MomofukuI got the #2 Shiyo Ramen and it was fine. Compared to all the ramen places I've been including a few spots outside the US this was the most visually boring and the least amount of garnish. I wish it had more garnish but that's personal preference. The dashi melts away so all really you get is half of a soft boiled egg, which is two bites. So after that you're just left with pork, noodles, and scallions scattered about. I think all the places I've been have spoiled me. I'm not even comparing it to past Tonkatsu Ramen dishes either. Add something.The reason for the 2 rating... The service or I should say one certain waiter. Keep in mind I'll give a 4.5 if I just get refills without asking so I'm very low maintenance. We must've been passively suggested to leave 3 times when there were only 2 ppl waiting by the door and keep in my you have the 8 top (maybe 10) table up against the sun room that was empty. In addition you have the stools up against the windows. Sunroom I understand you may not want to open back up since it's almost 9. He PROACTIVELY said things like: \"What dishes can I take away from here?\" (Tone wasn't one of trying to be helpful but obviously to move us along)\"How about I get the check for you all?\" (Tone was not to be super helpful at all either but that passive aggressiveness which was further emphasized by other snooty statements like that. Food was still in front of us fyi)\"Let me see what other dishes I can get out of your way?\"Completely unacceptable.... Maybe it was an off night or bad training but when you barely have a wait with plenty of seating it's not acceptable. Yeah I could understand if you're slammed to the gills but at the same time serivce is your x factor. its imperative and crucial to remember service can ruin amazing good since its an experience business, not foodservice business. They do not have the reputation nor the traffic of Ichiran or Tsuta to treat people like dog $***.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were sat at a large table with another couple at the other end. I'm a huge fan of the community table, but it's always hit or miss. It's pretty low key and laid back here. Not overly packed. It was honestly a great way to end the week. Appetizer: we ordered the hot chicken buns. It's the typical Asian steamed bun with a crispy hot chicken  in between with a pickle and perhaps a small amount of slaw. I'm not sure if I'm starting to like pickles or it just paired well, but I originally took the pickle off only to find it was better together. Ramen: I ordered the number one Tennessee tonkatsu. I was really hungry and couldn't finish it. The portion was great. I think it was $14. I felt good about it. My boyfriend ordered the spicy miso. He liked it but said he'd probably get something else next time. Overall, we'd go again.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My friends are vegan and I am vegetarian, so sometimes it's difficult to find a nice place to eat with selections that we can choose from (especially without needing to modify and feeling like you're a PITA).I LOVE making homemade ramen and had been craving ramen from a restaurant for months. Otaku Ramen satisfied that craving! We tried both vegan dishes (Veg. Shoyu and Smoky Corn Mazeman) and they were both absolutely delicious. My husband got the Tennessee Tonkotsu and loved it as well.We also shared an order of roasted cauliflower and was completely blown away by how good it was; you should definitely give it a shot!The poppy music was a little obnoxious, and we were seated right next to another full table with a whole patio of tables open, but other than those VERY minor details, it was exactly what I was hoping for! We will absolutely be revisiting.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Incredibly, my trip to Nashville would have been incomplete without coming here.Love ramen as we do not have any places in SoFla that offer it. I usually make my own but can never find authentic noodles. And I haven't attempted the complexity/time it takes to get the broth down. Hmmmm seems like a good entrepreneurial idea for anyone able down here.We started with the great beer and bun appetizer deal where they give you a beer and shrimp or chicken bun for $7. The buns were so hot and soft. We all had different varieties of the ramens. And can appreciate the local fusion feature. I had the Spicy Miso and the spice was just at my perfect level of spice. The flavor of the broth and freshness of the noodles are what really make the ramen here worth it! Caution: there are no forks. Only thing is it's depressing to come back home and not have anything like Otaku here. Check my reviews, i've looked for and been to and they do not compare.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our waiter was quite knowledgable and seemed genuinely interested in helping us out and conversing about the food and the restaurant in addition to answering some questions we had about the surrounding area. As for the food, we got both the Spicy Miso and the Sichuan Ramen. The Spicy Miso was as delicious as you'd expect - sweet, tangy, full of flavor. Their Sichuan ramen with Sichuan peppercorns was my favorite though. I lived in and around Sichuan, China for 3 years, and this is the first time since I've been back in the states that I tasted a restaurant that accurately used the sichuan peppercorn in their flavoring. It tasted like what I remembered Sichuan noodles tasting like in China, but with that fusion twist to differentiate it and make it Otaku Ramen's own unique American fusion dish. I LOVED it and hope they keep it on their menu for a long time to come.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My friend was visiting and I thought we should go somewhere I hadn't even been to and that was new for her as well. We found parking in the Pine St Flats garage and at $4 for up to 3 hours that is a deal! We walked up and around the block and walked into Otaku and were sat fairly quickly for 2 people on a Friday night (also St Paddy's day, too). We sat in the back area near the bar and got some waters right away. We also ordered some Steigl Radler beers and then for food I ordered the Tennessee Tonkotsu and she ordered the Curry Shio with shrimp. The food didn't take too long and once the bowls were brought out, they were the perfect size for dinner. My food was amazing and my friend loved hers, she had never had ramen before.

I ordered pork buns and ramen. The pork buns were pretty good. It was flavorful with a little crunch. Personally, i would prefer smaller pieces of pork rather than such a big piece. I think it would've made it easier to consume. The ramen broth was great. The noodles, however, were a little thinner than I would've liked. When I think ramen I think of wavy noodles of a certain thickness. This one seemed to be thinner than normal but not as thin as angel hair. Although I didn't try it, points to the chef for offering okinomiyaki. I haven't had this in years.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

You would never in Japan ramen find some of the ingredients they use here. (Sichuan peppers in Ramen??) That said, this place is absolutely top notch. They play on Japanese ramen flavors (and noodels depending on which bowl you get), and they clearly know not just how to use these ingredients, but what is traditional and how to use fresh as well. I had the Sichuan Pork and was incredibly happy. It's one of the only times I can remember an American joint using the real sichuan peppers that gives your mouth and lips a numbing, tingly feeling. If you don't like the type of food, I get it...but to question it's quality, freshness and playful version of ramen just isn't right. Whoever is running this joint knows what they're doing and the service is up to par with the food. From the bartender in the back (I think her name was Angela), to the waiter, everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, willing to offer opinions and generally great to deal with.I'll be back, and I'll be bringing my Japanese friends.

Just like the old spot, you share tables with other people, which is nice so that way they can fit more people in. If I remember correctly, there's also a seated bar area  right in front of the kitchen. Aside from the pictures on the wall, decor around the restaurant is minimal but still has a touch of modernization. There's a nice outdoor patio, but it was too hot that day for anyone to be seated there. Again, I've eaten from here in the past and fell in love instantly. I've previously tasted the lemon paitan and veggie miso ramens. Both were delicious! The okonomiyaki is to die for. My mouth salivates just thinking about it. My most recent visit was unfortunately not my favorite. I normally don't get pork bc if I'm with my boyfriend, we share foods and he doesn't eat it. I figured since I wasn't with him this time, why not?? My girlfriend got the TN tonkatsu and I got the spicy miso. She devoured hers instantly. Mine took a little longer to finish bc I felt mine tasted a bit on the saltier side. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were still good, just salty for my palette. I definitely won't let this hinder my total experience bc that was really the only issue. On a brighter note, I luckily came on a Sunday which happens to be the only day they serve okonomiyaki! Better believe we got it. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive, and I'll definitely be back.Update. Went back on a Friday for lunch and it was pretty packed. Only had to wait about 15 min so it wasn't too bad, just very confined in the waiting space. We had the hot chicken buns and ando paitan ramen and they were delicious! Definitely wasn't as salty as the spicy miso.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The dining room was small and seating seemed limited (in both the dining area and waiting area). Our group ordered the Hot Chicken Buns (comes with 2 in an order) and the Tennessee Tonkatsu Ramen. The Hot Chicken Buns was spicy... VERY SPICY and we opted for the mild version. The chicken was very crispy, which was nice but way too spicy for me. I would not order again. The Tennessee Tonkatsu Ramen, on the other hand, was delicious. It had a pork \"meatloaf\" as the protein, which was interesting. I usually prefer sliced meats in my ramen. I also ordered an extra egg in mine because I love eggs in my ramen. The flavor of the ramen was perfect, and the noodles were bouncy in texture - may possibly be the best ramen I've ever had.

Two blocks from my hotel!!It's not a very large restaurant, but with inside and outside dining rooms as well as a counter facing the kitchen, it's very American style. A lot of noise including the chef calling out orders. Still, they have some Japanese beers available and they also have sake.Just six different ramen bowls available. Two cold and two hot. I chose the hot one with lemon and chicken. Not nearly as salty as some of the other reviews have suggested  Lots of flavor and great texture with the chicken confit (too much dark meat, I think). The noodles were medium firm and the broth was very very hot.Oh, and I also had the chicken buns to start. Nashville style chicken on a Japanese-style bun with pickle and cabbage. A nice hat tip and clever design.Food was great, service was very good, the restaurant layout was open and welcoming. All quite delish.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm thrilled to have a ramen house in Nashville, and now that I work just a few blocks away from it, I'm definitely going to be going here as often as I can!\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Then we all ordered various ramen dishes. I had #5 (Curry Shio). It was all SO good!! Service was quick and our waitress was so helpful. Love love love this place and will definitely be coming back.

    "comments": "Based on the reviews, we ordered the Nashville hot chicken buns and the Smoky Corn Mazeman ( extra spicy ) ramen and I am now beginning to salivate reminiscing on this meal. We enjoyed everything and plan on returning next time we are in Nashville. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the Mazeman spicy corn ramen. More of a cold noodle dish than what comes to mind when one thinks a ramen but regardless, it was delicious. My only complaint would be the crispy pozole. Functions more of a garnish and less as a texture component. Chewy and starchy. I wound up picking all of the pieces out. The chicken bao was a very healthy portion with equally robust flavors and my dining companion was happy to be able to say that we ate hot chicken while we were in town :-)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've been hesitant in trying this place. Mostly due to hearing about how salty the ramen was. Then having gone to two ten jack and felt that it was a disappointment and maybe it's not meant for Nashville to have good ramen.. But this isn't about two ten. So let's get serious here... The ramen was not salty at all actually the broth was not too bad. The hot chicken bun is to push the crowd out the way just to grab the last one type of good.. But let me focus on the ramen just a bit.. I've had ramen in San Fran, Chicago, DC and many other places.. This doesn't really come close. In all aspects the price point, taste, and quantity of ingredients keeps it from being a 4 star or better. One piece of meat and and a half egg doesn't really add up to the 12 dollar price point and 1 dollar for a tea spoon of chili oil.. Ok, so one reason I would come back is those damn hot chicken buns. Perfectly cooked, with slaw, and a pickle sheesh is this a hot chicken bun place or what! Maybe they should call it otaku hot chicken.. All jokes aside I'd come back as the ambiance is nice, quick service (though our server was like a robot) Id tell you her name but she never introduced herself. The drinks are decent as well. So if you don't mind spending 12 bucks on a bowl of ramen then go for it. It's not memorable but may satisfy the craving.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They have an open kitchen which is cool till you look over at them and none of them look like they are enjoying their job. (They look like they hate being there) So that's a super bummer. At least pretend?Host: Seemed annoyed to be working.. or that we came in an our before closing. One of the two. Or both.Service: Pretty unwelcoming. Got my order wrong. Didn't check back to see if everything was correct after we got our food. I was hungry and the ramen was good so I ate it.. just wasn't what I wanted. Our server dropped the check and said, \"no rush.\" But at that point we didn't want to be there any longer because of the stand-offish ambiance. So we payed the bill and left. No one said goodbye. No one smiled. No one seemed to be in charge. Just really confusing considering it's a business that relies on happy customers. I hope they adjust the staff because there's much to be desired. The food is good, but this place made me so uncomfortable I won't be going back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "When I say I like Fusion food, THIS is what I'm talking about.Not a hipster pho place with only white customers and white chefs, not americanized chinese, or inauthentic upscale and over priced sushi.This.Otaku has come a long long way since the days of its very subpar pop up experiences.They've gone from pitiful attempts at creating proper ramen, to creating the kind of food that is wholly unique for the fun of it. Unabashedly taking inspiration from many cultures at once to create something unique. The way fusion should be doneWe ordered Nashville hot chicken in lotus buns with honey and pickles as a starter. You wouldn't think fried chicken tenders would go well with steamed buns, but the use of dark meat instead of white, with fatty bites, and the saltiness of the spice blended with the sweetness of the honey, greatly emulated the components of a traditional pork belly bun. The pickles were a fun contrast to traditionally used pickles and cut through the fattiness of the thigh meat very well.The Tennessee Tonkotsu takes a smoky bbq approach, used tender, fatty pork with only the major accompaniments being woodear fungus, able to absorb the deep, rich flavor of the savory broth, with a crunch reminiscent of cartilage, and scallions, to add the herby spice to the bites of meat and noodles. However, it dearly missed some element to cut through the richness of the broth and meat, such as menma or pickled ginger. The spicy miso was even more adventurous. The miso paste is chunky with soybeans, and the use of kimchi adds an acidic, Sriracha like flavor to the broth. The soybeans and chilli also reminded me of do ban zhan, but without the saltiness. The bean sprouts and Sriracha like flavors felt pho like, but the creaminess of the broth added with minced pork as the meat reminded me of lao or thai soups. Could've used some bursts of sweetness to cut through the salty miso however, I think corn would've gone great like in some miso ramens.The flavors were incredibly strong with each bite, and the noodles clung to the broth incredibly well.Overall the meal was an incredible fusion dining adventure.Not sure I would go back again, perhaps, but certainly not as a regular. The food is not homey or craving inducing, but I would highly recommend this for dates, or taking visiting friends, as the experience is lively, fun, and engaging.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I came about an hour before they closed for the lunch hour so I wasn't too busy and I didn't have to wait long. I also went there alone so I sat at the bar top and did some Interneting on my phone.Service was good, I mean I was alone so I wasn't too picky or needy with service. I ordered the vegetarian ramen and it was really good. It was a bit salty, more salty than I am used to but it is ramen so I guess I can't be that surprised. Overall it was a great meal and I would definitely recommend coming here for any first timer. I would not go back right away if I were in town because I know there is so much more to explore, but a great place to stop in.I think it would be great for groups of people, I also have limited options due to the no meat thing! Nice and clean, I love the window seating but my favorite is sitting by the cooks and watching them do their thing.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I stopped by otaku for dinner last week as I thought hot ramen would be the perfect complement to a cold, rainy day. We arrived at the restaurant (which is unlabeled from the outside) around 7:30pm and was quoted a 30 min wait time. This was fine since the restaurant didn't take reservations. While we were waiting, we ordered from the whiskey bar and ended up waiting for a full hour before our table was available. The service was fine, but the tonkatsu ramen I ordered didn't quite meet my expectations. The broth was very flavorful and tasty, although a bit salty. The noodles were a bit too al dente and the slice of fried pork cutlet was very chewy and greasy. Overall, I would give the ramen 3 stars. It was good, not great, but I appreciated the large portion size and the ability to slurp my food without shame.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I went in for lunch around 11 on Friday and there wasn't a wait. YAY! but it did start getting busier around 12. I would probably recommend going around 11:30 to skip the wait. I ordered the set combo, because why not. Sometimes a girl just has to treat herself, ya know.  The set combo allows you to choose one ramen, side item, and a bun. The Tennessee Tonkotsu was bit saltier than I thought it would be. It had a piece of SUPER fried and dried pork in there... Did not like that at all, hence the four stars. The hot chicken bun was a lot better than the ramen. I would definitely recommend ordering the hot chicken buns! I thought it was weird that the side items were mainly sauces... I feel like it's a rip off to be paying for sauces?!?! The typical ramen place that I frequent usually offers raiyu or togarashi on the side for you to put in. But I can't complain too much because this is the closest thing to \"authentic ramen\" here.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We ended up here on a COLD COLD evening, winds blowing, north face on , boots on, gloves on , heaters on :).  Walking in space looked perfect and open concept, you can see a few tables which are community and the bar is in the back where you will have to walk to. Since there was a wait we put our names on the list and headed to the bar to see what it  looked like. There were alot of people waiting for their turn.We were seated in the community table and the menu was presented, it looked pretty good and minimalistic. Choose your 4 appetizers , 3 kinds of Ramen your drink and you are out. This looked perfect and quick.Appetizer - The hot chicken bun - oooh so good and perfect, the chicken felt like hattie Bs hot chicken with a twist in a bun and some sauce i ordered on the side which i forget what it is.Main - Veggie Ramen and Chicken Ramen-  Keep in mind the chick ramen has no meat but the broth and if you order it with Szcehuan sauce on the side gives it a good cook. The ramen was perfectly hot and you could just begin dipping in and slurping your way around. After 15 min you wil lbe done with the ramen and all filled up.Place is worth a visit specially in this cold weather and if you have the snizzeles you will be cured MaMa style.  Enjoy it\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We ordered gyoza, the donburi of the day (which was chashu), and tonkatsu ramen. The gyoza came in 5 pieces and it tasted like gyoza you can get in the freezer section of any Asian market. This was $7!! The chashudon was good, but $12 for that small bowl? Not worth it. Lastly, the ramen, which was $15. What bothered me the most were the noodles. They were thin and stringy, which I really didn't like. The broth was okay, nothing great about it. The pulled pork patty was a nice touch since its in Tennessee, but eh. It breaks apart in the bowl, so you can't really get big chunks of pork. I realize that I shouldn't have had high expectations since I'm from LA.

    "comments": "I enjoy ramen, and I'm not talking the cheap grocery store kind.  I was super pumped for Otaku Ramen to open in the Gulch, because I'd had their hot chicken buns at a local festival.We had to wait a minute for a seat, given the small space and busy weekday lunch timing, but it was worth it!  We were seated at the bar, which gives some good vantage points of the meal prep.  I like the minimalist, intimate setting; it feels like a little ramen shop should, though I bet they could expand and still have a crowd.  It feels good to see a crowd at a restaurant, because it kind of signals to you that it's good, right?At lunch, they offered a \"set\" where you could get one bun and a sauce accompaniment with your ramen, so of course I used the opportunity to get another hot chicken bun.  The \"bun\" is a fried spicy chicken on a steamed bao bun,  a neat take on the traditional Nashville hot chicken.  Of course it's served with a dill pickle, and there's also a kewpie slaw.  I loved that the chicken wasn't too greasy, and the softness of bao buns makes me happy.  I think it's one of my favorite hot chicken dishes (sorry, purists) in the city as a result.For my ramen, I chose the TN Tonkotsu: pork bone broth, pork confit, woodear mushroom, black garlic oil, scallion, and an egg.  I mean, those are all delicious things, all in one bowl!  The portion size was very generous.  It felt like a bottomless bowl, because I'm not accustomed to eating a ton of ramen in a sitting like you're supposed to (I know, I'm such a fake foodie), but I'm not complaining!  I loved the runny-ness of the egg, and the bowl was full of flavor.  I slurped it down happily.  Great portion size!I can't wait to get back to Otaku Ramen!  And given the number of restaurants in Nashville that I still need to try, that's saying something.  I think next time I'll try the Paitan, their chicken ramen dish.  I feel like this is ramen comfort in a nutshell.I'd say it's right on par with the bowl I had at Two Ten Jack in East Nashville a while back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It is definitely more on the hipster side for the Gulch as well. The food options are minimal, which is actually nice because the dishes are a little complicated. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when deciding what to get. I got the spicy miso and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was huge, so even though the prices may seem high for \"Ramen\" the quality and amount of food is well worth it. The drink menu is also very hip, featuring many Japanese alcohols that I had to ask about.

I've pretty much had all of their ramen, even the ones they don't have on their current menu. All of them are wonderful.What to try? My favorite ramen have always been tonkatsu and paitan. Tonkatsu is made with pork bone broth so it tends to be stronger and saltier. On the other hand, paitan is lighter since it's made with chicken broth. Look- I've had ramen in many many places and in many many cities. I also spent 2 weeks in Tokyo, Japan. Listen to me when I say that Otaku does their ramen well.I also got to try their hot chicken buns which were so good! Oh my gosh. I don't know if they make their buns themselves but their hot chicken bun is so delicious. They had a lunch special where you could get a bun plus ramen and an add on to your ramen for only $14. It was such a deal and we were so full by the time we left.In regards to their add ons, I normall get their rayu chili oil or spice bomb. I haven't had the other ones but the rayu chili oil always gives my ramen a more in depth flavor that I can't eat my ramen without it.Ambiance/WaitThe ambiance of this place is really cool. It's small just like any other ramen places you'll find in Japan. This is probably one thing that you will have to prepare for before coming here. Prepare to wait. We got lucky the first time we came here and walked right in. Most of the time, I always see people waiting in line outside. Make sure you try to miss the lunch or dinner crowd. Make sure you also don't mind eating with other people since you share tables with them.Honestly, I'm so glad Nashville is attracting all these chefs and all these restaurants starters and I'm so so glad we have one of the best ramen in the nation. I love it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They do accommodate to the Gulch crowd, which leans towards hipster, but the basics of ramen was still there, so I was part of the clean bowl club towards the end of the meal. The hot chicken buns were good although I wish the bao wasn't over steamed. Our water was lukewarm for both bottles they served. I had to request ice.

I couldn't even really taste the egg pancake at all. The ramen was way too salty. Good presentation but I needed at least three cups of water before finishing half way. Not only that, but the meat itself was burnt and ruined the taste of the soup broth. Only good thing about this place is the service.

Their chopsticks and napkins were really cool and good quality. Water was also really clean tasting. The ramen was super salty tho. I got the shoyu ramen and it tasted good but was just way too salty for me to finish. I tried a little bit of the number one ramen which is pork bone broth and it was really oily tasting. The appetizer dumpling were okay, definitely not house made. The food was really promising(smelled great and looked amazing) but I feel like it was over done on the saltiness and oily-ness.

It was extremely salty, the broth, the egg, and the pork. I also got the Japanese pancake which is a special on Sunday's only. It wasn't good at all. It tasted mostly of mayo and extremely mushy and part burnt. It comes on a skillet. The pork in the ramen is very burnt too, all you can really taste is the charred meat. The egg itself tasted like it's been sitting in soy sauce way too long because the yolk itself tasted extremely salty. The broth tasted like chicken broth, dashi and a load of soy sauce. Nothing authentic about that. I would not come back again, we paid $11 per bowl of noodles and to me, that was way too overpriced for how bad it tasted. They also have an open kitchen, which means this place was hot. It's kind of sucks to eat a bowl of hot noodles while sweating at the same time because it was so hot.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I have had to demote my rating of Otaku based on my recent visits. While Otaku started strong, they have steadily slipped in terms of quality of flavor and overall value of their food. I believe their Ramen is tasty, but instead of setting the standard they have decided to sit right below it. By that, I mean their ramen is about average quality and compares less favorably to places like Two Ten Jack. The menu has changed every time I have visited, and recently, it has not changed for the better. I hope they can get back on track and start producing better ramen than before because my most recent experience was a disappointment. There were only about 3 oz of pork in my spicy miso ramen and the broth was meh. The broth was not very creamy, but flavorful, and lacked in critical areas like depth of flavor and ultimately, the noodle quality seemed subpar- mainly by the fact it was crunchier than normal.Maybe the restaurant can redeem itself sooner, rather than later, else it succumb to the standard trap of decently good food without any incentive to get better. I have high hopes, please don't disappoint.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We sat outside on the patio since the weather was beautiful. I love the space, furniture, and interior of this restaurant - clean, simple, and modern.We tried both the hot chicken and duck buns for appetizers. The hot chicken bun was better than the duck simply because the meat and sauce combination was much more juicy and flavorful than the duck.Ramen - will preface this with the fact that I have a weird taste in ramen... I don't think my \"favorite\" ramen is necessarily the \"best\" ramen (I've had \"great\" ramen in Tokyo and thought it was just so-so), so heed my review with caution! I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and really loved it! I thought the broth was just perfect in flavor and seasoning. The best part of this dish was definitely the pork chasu. It was so tender and juicy. As for the noodles themselves, it was not too hard/chewy, more bouncy and on the soft side - which is what I love in my noodles. I ordered the garlic as a side which surprisingly added a ton more flavor to the broth itself but not overwhelmingly so.I would definitely come back again when craving ramen as this is probably one of the best places to get your ramen fix in Nashville!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was informed that they ran out of a ingredient (bean sprouts ) and was told that the management refused to let us replace the missing mushrooms with anything. This really put me off. It was also like a legal battle to get them to remove onions. You must have a serious allergy for them to leave them off. Our waitress literally had to ask and go back between us and whoever to get them off. RIDICULOUS!      Really guys? Are you so cheap that you won't replace a item that I essentially paid for and you failed to deliver to me with something  of equal or lesser value. You would think something so small wouldn't matter but it's the principle of the situation.

I think it needed more protein so.....\"Add protein\" - I added the pork belly protein. They charged $2 for a single piece of pork belly.   Am I paying for them to raise the pig themselves? There are a couple places in Nashville where you can get 2-3x more pork belly for $2 so I feel they could offer an additional piece for price.Service: Coming in at 6PM on a weeknight, restaurant was half empty yet as I ate my appetizer, there was no offer to refill my empty water glass.

    "comments": "SYNOPSIS:I agree with the previous poster Issa C. on 12/27/2016 that this place is hella overpriced because they have no competition and most Nashvillians probably don't know how real ramen is supposed to taste. For the high price point, more effort should be made to serve better quality and more quantity instead of relying on being a trendy hipster place. Novelty will eventually wear off. Besides that, having tall, uncovered trash cans right next to customer seating is a violation of TN Department of Health ordinances and just plain gross!  For more detailed review of my experience, read below: Ate here on Sunday night ~8:30pm. Indoor dining was 70% full with small groups sporadically seated at their family-style tables.  Being a solo diner, I got seated at the end of the counter, right next to the trash can on the end. My knee knocked it several times. Does TN Dept of Health allow tall, uncovered trashcans right next to patrons?ORDERED:  Tennessee Tonkotsu. Their signature paitan dish was sold out. BROTH: Any respectable ramen place should have decent tonkotsu as standard backbone broth, but this broth was extra salty and way too thick. NOODLES: They were undercooked (too firm) and balled up in the center (not even slightly teased loose after broth was poured). Quantity was on the low side.EXTRAS: The pulled pork was very tender and seasoned on the salty side, but would be a great accompaniment to any ramen dish. Soft-boiled egg was cooked perfectly, but only got a stingy 1/2 and served ice cold, like it was pulled straight out of the fridge, sliced, and thrown into my bowl. SERVICE/AMBIANCE: Hipster staff & kitchen crew that match the hipster patron population; more into socializing or looking cool than into cooking or serving. Ramen bowl was clunked down to get my attention on the counter shelf above me by the kitchen staff; they couldn't even be bothered to reach over the counter and place it nicely in front of me.  PRICE: Final bill with tip was $18. For ramen! NOT WORTH IT. Comparatively speaking, there are plenty of better places to eat in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Don't expect this to be authentic Japanese ramen or anything immitating it. This a unique take, fusion if you will, of Ramen with a Tennessee twist. Coming from Houston I was skeptical of the ramen but I've come to love each restaurants different takes on it. Shoyu 5 of 5. A light and flavorful Soy Dashi broth with the most beautiful piece of Chashu I've ever had. We've got a whole thanksgiving sized slice of tender, pan fried, more meat than fat, pork. Paired with thick noodles and a soft boiled egg, it presents a cohesive bowlTennessee Tonkotsu 4 of 5. Salty. Get over it. Real Tonkotsu is salty. The pork confit, like the Chashu is also pan fried into one huge rich and salty mass. What takes the salt intake over the edge and makes this dish stand out, the MARINATED woodear mushroom. Hot Chicken Buns 3 of 5. Riding on the hot chicken band wagon is their Steam Bao Hot Chicken. It's a good execution but fails to impress. The Bao wasn't warm or fluffy, more dense ans unevenly steamed. The chicken fried hard, somewhat over fried. Put the two together and you have the makings of something pretty decent but not WOW.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I gave Otaku 3 stars due to the ridiculously long wait times and limited seating. Since then they have not only improved the amount of available seating, they have also made wait times a much easier thing to deal with via NoWait which you can download from both the iOS and Android app store. The service is still fantastic. The staff are still just as friendly as before. The food is also just as wonderful.

(Ken's Sushi off of Murfreesboro Rd. is a close contender, as well.)The shoyu is a solid option and quite tasty. The hot chicken buns are an epic Nashville twist and really delicious.

We got the hot chicken buns to start with. I am not typically a fan of slaw so we almost requested it off but decided that they probably know what pairs well together more than we do so we left it on. Glad we did, it was perfect. That bread is incredible and the flavors work together so well. Then we ordered the pork ramen since it is in a bone broth and added chili oil. Perfection. Everything about the meal was great.

    "comments": "I had been wanting to try Otaku since they opened the brick and mortar place in the Gulch and was finally able to this weekend.  My wife and I both ordered the Shio ramen with pork belly.  We both thought it was terrific.  The hot chicken bread is also terrific.  It is worth getting the lunch combination in order to get one of those as well as hot sauce for your ramen.The food and service was good enough to warrant a full five stars, but I did have a few small issues.  One, a coke is $3 and they actually bring it to you in the can.  Now, I know that can cost them about 50 cents.  At least put it in a tall glass so I don't know its a can.  Again, pet peeve, so not really taking away from the place at all.  The pork belly was also a bit chewy, but I did not pull any from their rating because that could be a bit of ignorance on my part.  I am used to pork belly in the BBQ slow cooked sense, so it could just be the difference in cuisine types.  Overall, wonderful experience.  I think most folks would enjoy themselves and get some wonderful comfort food in the process.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

And was so happy when I found out my hometown was evolving and now had a ramen shop so I had to stop by...Now let me begin this by saying I might not be Asian but have lived in Korea Japan and China a many of years to know what good ramen is and isn't from Miso to Tonkatsu to Shoyu I love ramen...So to begin we ordered the Chasu for appetizers... And to be on the safe side I had the miso it kinda hard to mess up miso... When my bowl arrived it was cold and barely enough broth to stir my noodles with. When I ask for some extra broth I was told that they don't have extra broth to hand out or to be purchased... Hmmm 2nd red flag then I proceeded to eat my bowl to find that my noodles were so mushy they broke apart on my chopstick... Gross. Then the broth was so bland it might as well been water... How do you serve egg with marinating it or Chasu that had were season or seared... As my fiancé finished his bowl here come our appetizer and single thin 3inch slice of flavorless Chasu. By far the worst experience having ramen I've had to date... Hopefully they get it together but I myself won't be returning unless it's someone else done to waste.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Order the ramen with the szechuan bomb - that sauce really blends in with the broth. I find it strange that the restaurant charges for the sauce though, usually they are complimentary. The wait is the least fun part though. We waited 15 minutes to get seated and about 30-40 minutes until the dishes are brought out. What annoyed us is that there are at least 3 tables being seated after us but being served before we were!\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The two stars is for the presentation of the food and the restaurant decor. My bowl of ramen just looked like a bowl of art. The restaurant itself was super hip, I felt like I was on a k drama set. Service was meh, my server was rude and barely smiled. I get it, bad day. Food was just bland. The noodles were hard, slightly uncooked. The broth had no taste. I was really disappointed when I only got half an egg. I've just had much better ramen elsewhere. Good to see the food scene in Nashville expanding.

    "comments": "I ate here for dinner two nights in a row, so yeah. I'm definitely a fan of Otaku Ramen! The first night I came in there was a 45 hour wait. Ok, kinda expected that, but it ended up being an hour. That was rather annoying. Aren't restaurants suppose to over estimate the time so you are pleasantly surprised when it's not that long? Any who, we were seated at the bar and each ordered the first vodka cocktail (don't remember the name) and the menu warned that it was strong. For food we had the hot chicken buns (OMG ORDER THESE - they are freaking heaven) and the Paitan plus the spice bomb and hot chili. It was so good. The broth was thick and amazing and I dumped all the spice into my ramen and it was pretty solid hot. I also loved the texture of the noodles. Visit number two was durning a slight tornado scare and we still had a 20 minute wait. This place is really small and people love them some ramen. We had the hot chicken buns yet again (Yes, they are really that good) and the Shoyu ramen add chili bomb only this time. This ramen had a more fish forward flavor and my chili bomb wasn't very spicy, even after using all of it. We also had the soy egg and karashi taken (similar to a turnip green). At first I thought I liked the Paitian more, but as I added the heat and customized the ramen I liked it more and more. They are both rich and delicious and an excellent bowl of ramen. My second gripe besides an incorrect wait time was that they need a better system for getting drinks out to customers. Both times I came in we waited for our drinks longer than we should have and were halfway through our hot chicken buns before they got to us. I sorta understood when I ordered a cocktail, but on my second visit we just had wine and beer and had to ask our server where they were. Obviously I am a fan of Otaku and will be back to try practically everything on the menu. I'm so glad they are in Nashville to satisfy my ramen cravings!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I don't think it's bad and that it deserves 1 star, but I also don't think it's good enough for a 3 or 4 star rating. 2 stars mean I've experienced better and I sure have. Otaku Ramen takes a good shot at making ramen with a Tennessee vibe. Personally, I don't think it's the best combination, but it does work. The shoyu ramen was good, but it didn't WOW me. You also have to pay to add sauces and other toppings which made me a little sad since I didn't want to spend more on lunch.

Granted, I'm not sure if it is a seat-yourself kind of establishment; it may have been a misunderstanding on my part.My waitress was great, but the food was rather subpar. The pork confit was tasteless and was not chashyu pork like I've come to expect from Tonkotsu ramen. The broth was fine, albeit a bit salty, and the bamboo shoots had a strange taste to them. The egg was cold in the middle. The decor was nice, but the music was too loud. And some of the staff seemed rather rude and wished I hadn't been there.To sum everything up, I think ramen is always better if you shoot to make it more Japanese and less experimental. This ramen is not very authentic and I really wouldn't recommend it. $13 is a lot to pay for ramen that isn't very good. I would imagine a good portion of the cost comes from the fact that ramen is trendy. Ramen in Japan is only 7 or 8 bucks and I don't know why it's so expensive here. I will say, they have improved from the first time I visited. As they say, third time is the charm.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Nashville has not been known for food genre's that rely on seafood, and for good reason. Tennessee is a land-locked state that relies on planes, not boats, to deliver the fruits of the sea. Therefore, Nashville's sushi + Japanese restaurants have been lacking compared to larger coastal cities like NYC and LA. Until now.What I loved about Otaku is that chef Sarah Gavigan created an authentic feeling ramen house that feels native to Tennessee. The menu is accessible. The fusion items (like hot chicken buns, pictured here) are authentic enough to still be adventurous for Nashvillians, yet familiar enough for dinner guests to not hesitate when they see the description. Otaku's menu integrates ingredients that are widely available in Tennessee (like pork and chicken), giving Otaku authenticity not only to the genre but to the region.This place is a must if you're in Nashville for a short time.On your first visit for two: order 1. Buns, 2. One Ramen order (with spice), 3. On Rice bowl (with spice), and 4. The beverage of your choice. Share with your dinner mate, and prepare for a return visit within a week.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I admit that I had a lot of trepidation going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. My coworker and I both had the TN Tonkotsu. I got the Set Special which included one hot chicken bun and a spice ($5 combined value?!) for only $4 more. The broth was excellent and you could definitely taste the pork in it. Adding in the Korean chili sauce made a world of difference. The only qualms I have are the price and size of the chicken bun. You're definitely paying for being in the Gulch. I would have given this 5+ stars if the price were lower. And don't get me wrong, it should be $4-$5 lower. I can't complain too much about this meal though. Server and hostesses were nice and helpful. Server forgot my coworkers spice, but rectified the situation pretty quickly when notified. All in all I'd recommend it at least once.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's really unique because they've put a Nashville twist on it with the hot chicken buns (it's like a slider), which is amazing. I got the Tennessee Ramen and it was pretty good. The waitress was fantastic, nice, and suggestive and the staff was fun. I'll definitely be back to try more. If you like ramen, it's worth the visit!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Best ramen in town by far. They take the time and have the attention detail that really makes the food great. The staff is extremely attentive, kind, and helpful. The ambience is small and casual, but pretty cool. I got the pleasure of sitting next to the owner and I think head chef. She was really cool and it was awesome that she took the time out of her day to explain the ingredients and processes. Kind of neat. Lastly, don't let the wall leading to the bathroom deceive you that that is where the restaurant ends. They have a really hip small bar just around the corner so keep walking. Overall a great ramen house and fun place to visit.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I woke up the next morning thinking about it! Bonus that it was a Vegan dish - vegetarian and vegan options are pretty limited in Nashville outside of vegetarian and vegan specific restaurants.

    "comments": "Otaku Ramen has all the charm of a local ramen joint, with an added bonus of being right in the heart of Nashville's trendy Gulch - a vibrant and bustling neighborhood. The restaurant is small, but makes up for it by offering outdoor dining in a small space just out the door. The seating is fine, although there's a weird median style bench without any back support. You'll be served water when you sit, but it's room temperature. A strange choice, but I won't pretend to be an expert on these things - so maybe there's a reason for it. We had the chicken buns as an appetizer.  These were spicier than I anticipated, but had explosive flavor, with coleslaw and pickles to cut some heat off of the chicken. The ramen was exquisite. The broth (my wife and I had two separate kinds, one pork based, one chicken based) was incredible. Rich, flavorful and simply delightful. Our waitress ruined the entire experience. Not only did she completely forget about us, she did not return any of my change - simply assuming it was her tip.  The longest wait of the entire evening was waiting for our check to be returned. The night ended on a poor note that left a bad taste in our mouths. It's a shame, could've been a great experience.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The two together were plenty of food for two people.The duck buns tasted great and had a nice crunch. The ramen was good with some pork belly and baby bok choy. We also got the Szechuan bomb. If you get a bomb, add it slowly. We threw the whole thing in and it got a little too salty. Get there early! We walked in at about 11:10a and were able to sit immediately.

However, we were welcomed to the bar/patio side to order drinks and appetizers while we waited for a table. The atmosphere on the bar side was great and our waiter super friendly. We got a round of drinks (my first time having Japanese beer!) and three appetizers: gyoza, okonomiyaki, and hot chicken buns. All were good but the chicken buns were standout and I would happily order them again. When the table was ready we moved back to the restaurant side to order our ramen. I ordered the Shio and was not impressed. The broth was not particularly flavorful and the pork super fatty. It could have used some extra sauce or seasoning, but unfortunately those cost an extra $1-2, which just personally annoys me. The others in my group seemed to like their dishes more so perhaps I just ordered the wrong one. But here's the real kicker. Not 2 minutes after we had all paid and gotten receipts back, a host or manager (not really sure which) brusquely came and removed all of our water glasses and the water jug. It was very obvious that she was trying to passive-aggressively get us to leave, despite the fact that one of us still hadn't finished her drink. Another 2 to 3 minutes later, the same woman came back and told us that there was an hour wait and they needed our table. Now I totally understand that, but I was shocked at the way she handled it. She did not ask us to leave or recommend us to move back to the bar, she just told us to go. This lack of very basic customer service skills was a poor way to end the evening.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Well, I am saddened to see some of the low star reviews.  I'm a fan (see my old review for Otaku South).  I hope these reviews are about off moments and not representative.  We certainly had a better experience.First, the new space is not quite what I expected.  With the move to The Gulch, I expected Otaku to go much more upscale, and frankly that worried me a bit. The new space is quite nice, but is an upgrade without losing Otaku's casual, fun atmosphere. Light wood. Lots of light.  It's a nice space.We ordered the Okonomoyaki and had a slice of pork belly added on top.  It came served in a cast iron skillet!  A hilarious east meets south moment!  What a perfect idea.  In Japan, Okonomoyaki is prepared on the table on a teppanyaki griddle.  The cast iron skillet holds heat well and is a fun substitute that keeps the Okonomoyaki hot on the table. The whole thing arrived smelling wonderful, with the little Bonita flakes waving hello to us.   And,, And, it was really good.  The pancake was crisp on the bottom and yet creamy and delicious inside.  As I said in my previous review, if you have never had Okonomoyaki, you need to try it, and Otaku Ramen is a good place to start.Ordering ramen, I was disappointed to see that the Assari Shoyu Ramen is no longer on the menu.  I had the Tennessee Tonkatsu and it was great.  Added some fresh garlic, a couple of extra ramen egg halves, and the spice paste.  Same excellent quality. I thoroughly enjoyed the noodles.Service was excellent. Our server and his trainee were attentive and had a good sense of humor -- a requirement when serving jokers like us.Overall, Otaku Ramen knocked it out of the park, for what it is.  A great, casual place that continues to capture the real spirit of good broth and good noodles.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Went here on a Saturday, was really excited to try a new ramen place as options are limited in Nashville.PROS:- not as pretentious as Two Ten Jack. Seemed like it was more about the food. Gave me the initial impression of a place I could see myself visiting regularly.CONS:- They literally kicked us out after we waited for ~25 mins with the excuse, \"Sorry, we're not gonna be able to work you in before we close.\" Hence the 1 star. More details below, if you care to read.The Story:My girlfriend and I walked in, it was really busy and there were a bunch of people waiting. The hostess looked over and literally made eye contact with me as I walked through the door, so she obviously knew when we showed up (around 1:50pm - they close at 2:30pm). About 5-10mins after we arrived, another group walked in and the hostess came over and turned them away because they wouldn't have time to fit them in before close. Yet another group showed up about ~15mins after we showed up and the same thing. My girlfriend and I look at each other and we're like, \"Sweet! We made the cut!\" Unfortunately, the hostess allowed us to wait at the front door, hungry, until ~2:15 before telling us we would not be served. Her excuse? \"We can only make 6 ramen at a time.\" Obviously frustrating because I have no idea why it took 30 mins to figure that out. I'm not mad at the hostess as much as I am the business policy. If you owned a new restaurant trying to make a name for itself, wouldn't you stay open an extra 15mins if someone has already waited a while for your food? Alternatively, if you absolutely had to turn someone away, wouldn't you offer them some consolation, like a voucher for a free appetizer or something during the next visit?Let's say you had plans to meet at a friend's house for dinner. You spend time getting ready and driving over, only to show up at your friends door and have him/her cancel on you at the very last second, without apology. Wouldn't you be upset? And that is a friend, not a business that CHARGES you money for your meal.I'm super bummed because I really wanted to like Otaku. However, I refuse to give this business any of my money after that experience. My experience at Otaku was the first time (and I hope last time) that I ever feel slapped in the face by a restaurant. No thank you.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We had the Shoyu and Sichuan Pork Miso.  It's hard to decide what broth i like the most because both are really good.  It just depends on what you are in the mood for.  The only thing I don't like is the fact you can't substitute items.  My stepdaughter wanted chicken instead of the pork belly on her Shoyu.  So you had to pay extra for the chicken to replace the pork belly.  We came in when it was busy, but didn't have to wait long and service was quick.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Otaku... Hipster popular west coast inspired Ramen house . My opinion here is a bit off the main stream but i just could not buy into what this place was selling. The Ramen was tasty, its of a style that is very flavor forward not subtle at all with a lot of salt. The ingredients are a mixed bag my egg was perfect but i did find the pork belly to be charred far too much. The tonkatsu broth was creamy and heavy which i like. The Lemon Paitan had a pleasant lemon flavor not overpowering and complimented the chicken broth but again so salty.  The shop is loud, bright, and hot. They play 80's music ironically and the price point.. I know your in the Gulch but 12 to 15 bucks for Ramen or a Donburi (which had the burnt pork belly) is just too much and 3 dollars for a canned coke! Come on. Ramen is a cheap food. Its boiled bones for goodness sake. I suppose i'm being an old man but this place seems to have some of the ideas of a Japanese Ramen shop with the open kitchen, the limited menu, and seating, the encouragement to eat fast, but it can't help itself to jazz and trend it up and thus run the price point out of where I feel good about eating here on anything other than a special treat type of occasion.  I cant imagine what they pay for rent in the Gulch so they have my sympathies but I wish someone could take some of their dishes and put them in a little more settled calmer place.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I am not crazy about ramen but even I have to admit it was pretty darn good. We shared the spicy miso ramen and it was great! Not too spicy, the right amount of noodles, delicious broth and the kimchi was on point. I couldn't have asked for anything more. After we ate we checked out the back for some cocktails with really cool Japanese names (the Wabi-Sabi was pretty refreshing). The only reason I wouldn't give this place a 5 star is really only because of the service. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't great. We didnt really get greeted at the door and the server didnt really say anything to us except when he asked what we wanted. Some of the waiters were gossiping kind of loudly next to us and while it wasn't too terrible (I mean, who doesn't like to over hear a juicy story?) it kind of left a bad impression. The bartender was friendly though! I definitely recommend this place if you want a super quick, delicious, and filling meal.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We have become regulars at Bakersfield because of Blake's service and friendliness so now that he works here, we will definitely be returning! The ramen was also AWESOME! My wife and I will likely become regulars here for their amazing food, unique drinks and fantastic service. Only advice is that you make sure and plan on there being a wait.

In regards to the food, we skipped on the appetizers and went straight for the ramen ($12). I got the Tennessee Tonkatsu and my bud got the Paitan Ramen. Overall, I thought the ramen was O-K. We both enjoyed the toppings on our ramen!  I thought the woodear mushroom with the balsamic vinegar was an excellent touch! However, we both thought the broth was overly salty.

We sat for over ten minutes with no water, no \"we'll be right with you\", and no eye contact from any of the waitstaff for that matter. We are patient people, but they weren't even busy... After multiple waitstaff walked by with no acknowledgment we just had to leave, which was a first for me. If someone would have pretended to care, we would have waited but everyone seemed ready to go home, so figured we should take our business elsewhere. Sad.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "today was opening day at otaku ramen, and they still have some kinks to work out. overall, though, a good place to go for a bowl of ramen. and i'm always happy to see more good asian restaurants opening in nashville! =)i tried the veggie ramen. the broth and the noodles were both amazing, but everything else it came with was rather blah. the radish was mushy, the baby bok choy was very oily, and the giant chunks of tofu were too big, too firm, and poorly seasoned. but, again... amazing broth and noodles! so overall, my bowl was still ok. it would have been nice to have a crunchier veg in there for texture or something pickled maybe for another layer of flavor? hubby got the tennessee tonkatsu, which he enjoyed. he said it was comparable to two ten jack. which is the other place we usually go. and he also liked the way the pork was prepared (instead of just the usual chashu).the venue itself felt rather cramped w/ limited seating. and our food took forever to come out. but it was their first day, so we'll give them a pass. all in all, i think i still like two ten jack better than otaku (venue wise and food wise). but not so much more that it's worth the longer drive.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This is the second day this brix and mortar location is open. I couldn't wait. My temperament is also very forgiving today. Dying for true ramen in Nashville and my gratitude may overwhelm, so take this review with a grain of salt. My boyz and I are kicking it up this Sunday. Supping on ramen and topping off the day with Star Wars. It doesn't get any better than this. Starting off with a glass of cava and a Japanese white ale. They are already out of duck buns and out of gyoza. We were warned and so I'm not grumpy. Well-being still high and intact. Our server today is a pretty young woman who used to serve us at Zushimaki in Franklin. And she says the ramen is great. She's Thai so I'm going to hold her to a much higher standard with that endorsement. The okonomiyaki were pretty darned good. We ordered two. It could have done with a little less tamari/sweet soy sauce, but otherwise, very tasty. Served in cast iron skillets--another nice nod to humble Southern cooking. The hot chicken buns are excellent. Perfectly fried, crispy, respectable heat inside steamed folded Chinese bread (bao) -- exceptionally pillowy, with a slathering of mayo and piquant pickles, respectful nods to Nashville's famous hot chicken, a la Japanese bar food style. We ordered another one. It was as good as the first. We all ordered the Tennessee Tonkatsu ramen, two without egg. Another nod to Tennessee--the pork is pulled pork rather than braised, seared char siu. I get the nod of respect but didn't want pulled pork in my ramen. We ordered these add ins that cane in ramekins-these let you doctor your broth, like pho. -miso butter--this transformed the broth and gave it depth--a little salty, buttery miso-Sichuan bomb (floral, sichuan peppercorn paste)--be careful and taste this. It is floral, a hit of black pepper-spice bomb (sriracha hot and a little sweet)-karashi takana (salted pickled mustard greens) -this should be a pickled counterpoint but was saltier than it should have been-chili oilThe broth was nice and hot but could have been hotter, steamier. Black garlic oil put a ring of char in the bowl. Wood ear mushrooms come in the bowl--dark, blackish brown, a toothsome counterpoint to the noodles. The broth is almost neutral tasting and begs your adornment. Mouth feel is a bit thinner than I like but the miso butter gives the broth a smooth, fatty deliciousness and is just salty enough. The ramen noodles are thin spaghetti noodles. I like my ramen noodles a little thicker and a bit more toothsome. These tasted just fine and were cooked nicely. Missing for me were: raw chopped garlic and sesame oil. Garlic is on the dinner menu but not available at today's lunch--too bad. Garlic transforms a bowl of ramen. Also missing was sesame oil. My broth would have exploded with garlic and sesame oil. The cocktails look excellent but I was told Otaku doesn't serve these until evening.All in all, this is a damned fine bowl of ramen for Nashville. We will be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm happy to report: Nashville has its own incredible ramen shop. I dare say better than Momofuku or Ippudo. Yes. Definitely better. The hot chicken buns are- as my Italian family says- TO DIE FOR. Paitan broth and chicken are insane. I had both last night and was nearly crying from joy. I would have taken a picture for y'all, but I ate instead. Oops. I've been eating at two ten to hold myself over until otaku opened their permanent shop.

However, I picked off times and did not wait at all. I had the creamy chicken ramen and loved it. It was simply outstanding. I am not a Ramen expert in any way but just somebody who appreciates delicious food. And delicious food is what i found here at Otaku. I also tried the duck bun but was not a big fan of it but it might very well be because I was really curious to taste the ramen. I will definitely go back to try the other items on the menu.I also had a drink on one of my visits and was very happy with it.

I want to give it 3 1/2 stars but as that's not an option,  I'll round to 4.  Overall I liked it and since I'm in the Gulch quite a bit I'll be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The ramen offerings here are solid. I had a Tennessee Tonkotsu. It retained all the traditional goodness of a classic tonkotsu pork marrow broth - rich and unctuous. I disagree with the earlier reviewer about the amount of pork. Most ramen houses serve two or three shavings of pork with the ramen, and that's it. In ramen, the noodles are supposed to be the star, and the pork/egg/scallions are just dressing.That said, this was not a perfect recreation of the kind of tonkotsu ramen you'd find in the streets of Hakata (the birthplace of tonkotsu, where I lived and worked for two years). Nor should it be! The \"Tennessee\" in Tennessee Tonkotsu was justified by a few creative twists - a few slight changes in seasoning and a sweeter, almost barbecue taste in the pork. I liked this. It was a nice blend of traditional and new.My husband ordered the donburi bowl, which we both agreed was lackluster. The rice was far too sweet and saucy, so that it had nearly turned into rice pudding by the end of the meal. Gyoza were also too soft, not seared crispy like they should be. My suggestion is to stick with what's in the name: ramen, washed down with a few Sapporo draughts.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The ramen was perfect and delicious with the right amount of kick. I had to take some home and was delighted the next day as well.

The noodles are perfectly cooked. This is a new ramen shop that opened in December 2015, so I hope more folks will start to come here. Service is so fast that it takes less than 5 minutes for the ramen to be on your table directly from the open kitchen. The ingredients are so fresh.

Do not order. Second I ordered the newer shrimp ramen.  The egg was frozen so apparently they no longer make fresh but comes frozen, the shrimp were so fishy it could not even be eaten. I had to send it back and I NEVER send food back.  By the time a new ramen showed up 25 min later the other person was done.   It is a shame bc we live in the gulch and it started so promising.  Terrible.  Do not go.  I used to eat there once a week and had not been in about 3 months and now I won't go back.  Too many good restaurants around town to spend money there and leave unsatisfied and hungry.  Terrible service and terrible food now.  What a shame :(\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Lastly the mochi was some super off brand nasty tasting stuff that they served with some awful salty caramel. I mean honestly you can buy mochi at Trader Joe's that tastes 1 million times better for a fraction of the price.

I've been to the other ramen place in town and wasn't super impressed. I thought there was enough food but I would've liked it more if there was just a little bit more veggies in the ramen. Nevertheless, the prices were reasonable and the ramen was served piping hot! The duck confit buns were great! Also there was a great bar selection, very interesting drinks!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Party of 4, we all had the chicken ramen bowls and hot chicken buns. The ramen does not even compare to Two Ten Jack. Tasted more like chicken noodle soup to me...maybe some black pepper - not very complex. The buns left something to be desired as well. Whole meal felt more like a southern take on ramen, which, if that's what they are going for, no one told me. Unfortunately, to top it off, our waiter was so short with every interaction that it came off rude and like didn't give a crap about us. He was like that with the other table nearby too, and it would be understandable if the place was slammed - but it was actually quite empty @ 10pm on Saturday night.We were bummed that we drove past Two Ten Jack to take out of town friends here for their first ramen experience! I've heard better things from a few people, so mayyybe it was a fluke, but no way I'll pick here again when we could stick with two ten, which we already love.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This was my first time having Japanese bun. I had one of each kind. The hot chicken was good, but the duck was better. Great flavor in both, and the bun itself was so good. Sticky and fluffy and delicious. My ramen was delicious. Chicken broth with a pretty big piece of pork served with it. The broth was smoky with a hint of seaweed and a really nice balance of sweetness. The noodles were very good and held the flavor of the broth well. My friend said \"is this what people mean when they have a religious experience?\" That sums it up.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Luckily they weren't out of anything (my friends' main gripe about the place), we really enjoyed the hot chicken bun as well as the duck bun (show stealer). I had the pork ramen and she had the night's curry and shrimp special ramen, both were great and was pleasantly surprised to be offered a  \"to go\" container for our leftovers, the other place in town forbids that practice. Parking is the typical gulch shit show and the space is tiny so expect communal seating, but the food was great and our server Heidi was quick with good service and beer/wine refills.

The toppings show a sense of style. The noodles had just the right texture and curl. Had the tonkotsu this time and I'm so excited to try the shoyu and paitan on future visits. There will be plenty. What surprised me the most was the okonomiyaki appetizer. Okonomiyaki is an Osakan specialty pancake that's really hard to find. It was delicious! From the batter to the special sauce, seaweed and bonito flakes- everything was on point. Don't miss out on this! Personally I enjoyed more than the ramen. Otaku South will turn you on to a whole new way to enjoy Japanese food. I'm thrilled they are here in Nashville!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Regardless, having been to Japan multiple times and eaten ramen both there and in New York and Boston which come close to replicating the authenticity, this place is nowhere near authentic. It want to be, but it's not. It is still pretty good for the most part. Solid noodles to go with a serviceable broth. I was not a fan of the pork though, way too much fat on it to be enjoyable.

The duck and hot chicken buns are cooked to perfection, served on soft, pillowy bao buns. My favorite ramen is the Paitan, a perfect dish for a rainy day. I've also tried the Tennessee Tonkatsu which has a great, smoky flavor and slightly different noodles. A great addition to the Gulch!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'd put Otaku right in the middle.  It was good, but it would've been great if: the broth was a few degrees hotter, the price was a few bucks less, and the ducks buns had a smear of hoisin. I liked what I ate but I don't think I would wait an hour for a table (we showed up right at 5pm for dinner) The service was fine and the bar looks like it might be cool. I'll probably be back to try the Donburi and adult beverages.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm not even a huge fan of hot chicken and this has been my favorite version by far. I am obsessed with the TN Tonkotsu. I know I need to branch out and try new things but I literally have dreams about it, so why fix it if it ain't broke?They are now on the NoWait app so we jump in line right before we are about to leave the house and the wait is no problem. Even if there is a wait, you can walk down to hops and crafts to get a few beers and play a board game and they will call/text you when your table is ready.

    "comments": "Wowsers. This place is YUMMY. Went here recently when my fiancé and I were craving some good ramen, and didn't really feel like cooking. The main area was a little busy, but we went over to the tiny little bar that is attached and got cocktails while we waited. While we were there, one of the bartenders informed us that we could eat at the bar so we were happy to! Definitely stop in for the cocktails, they're well worth it. The cocktails have a great fusion of Asian and American ingredients and were pretty well balanced. I ordered the TN tonkotsu ramen and my fiancé got the Soyu. As you might know, ramen comes out piping hot and continues cooking, so you have to eat it pretty quickly. This was no problem for us. The broth was incredibly flavorful, and the components merged so nicely into a wonderful warming bowl of magic. The service was fairly good, and the food was excellent. A little pricey, and the drinks, while good, are a little less than adventurous.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our second experience left us a little put off though. We dined at the bar in the back, and the bartenders seemed really indifferent towards most of the customers. They did not acknowledge us for quite a while despite it being only a 10 seat bar. We were never offered a cocktail or food menu. Instead of trying to give half decent service, they did multiple saki bombs with their friends at the bar. I can excuse lackluster service if you are busy, but not for you to just drink on the job. On top of that, they reused some customers beer mugs instead of using a clean mug each time when pouring draft beer. That's just gross! In short, tough out the longer wait time and eat in the main dining area for a much better experience.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I made some for my boyfriend and I a few weeks ago and it came out to $6 each - compared to $24 for two ramen dishes at this place. I went here today and was underwhelmed. The broth was good, but not amazing. Chicken was dry. Noodles were okay. I ordered the miso butter which spiced it up a little bit.

    "comments": "I love ramen. I love ramen houses, the culture involved and surrounding ramen, and ultimately it taste good and is just very comforting as a whole. That being said Otaku fulfills that need, and want for ramen in a city that is still very new to it. There are things they do extremely well here. The food is amazing you need the Duck Buns..... Trust me. You need them in your life. They are bao bread done in a taco style with duck confeit along with duck skin for added texture, taste, and surprise. They're just flavorful and everything that duck should be, along with a cool flair on \"buns\". Now on to the Ramen. The Tennessee Tonkotsu was my choice for Ramen on my first outing there, and so naturally now I have dreams about it. It's fantastic! It truly is. The depth in the broth is just phenomenal, the noodles have the perfect chew. The pork is pulled pork style, then grouped together and seared before being added to the broth. It's this thought into detail that makes this Ramen bowl so great. The egg, the scallions, the mushrooms (which I got a hint of ginger from, or I'm crazy?) all worked in such unison to create something so complex, yet so naturally comforting. This isn't some over-hyped, new Nashville, kitschy, thing. That's probably what I appreciate most. This is real ramen, done at a really high caliber. Downside, the room is tight, you'll be waiting to get in to this place more than likely, so plan accordingly (this will be true for at least the next year and a half, because Nashville loves \"that new food place\"). Also Sam (Sushi Sam) was the one that really informed me of Otaku, he told me it reminded him the most of home, so I knew then I would have a good experience and it truly was. It has left me excited about returning.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We finally had a chance to come in for lunch between Christmas and the New Year! The service was excellent! We sat at the bar and we both felt well taken care of, and welcome. The ambiance of the new Otaku is great, the open kitchen lends a vibe similar to many of my favorite Japanese restaurants in LA. We had the chicken paitan, which was SO good, and of course the never to be missed hot chicken buns. I must admit the hot chicken was a little milder than I liked (and had had before at the old location), maybe an option of \"hotter\" would be cool, or maybe it was just super busy and newly opened and that batch just wasn't as spicy? I didn't think at the time to order a spice bomb though to go with that, so maybe that's what I'll do next time.We always had the chicken paitan at the east location so I must sheepishly admit to missing the amazing shredded chicken they used to make, but I am a taurus and a creature of habit so you know :)I can't wait to come back again and again to one of my new/old top five restaurants in Nashville, Otaku!!!Thanks for making such great food and congrats on the new location!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

One hour wait to get seated, plus one hour to wait for food is just too long for Ramen.  Woefully inefficient kitchen staff.  This place would be out of business in Japan where you can have a hot bowl in under 10 minutes at the slowest.2. The noodles were just OK.  Shio was a bit too salty (yes, I know shio means salt).3. Price on the high side of reasonable.We did however have the Tennessee tonkotsu, which was EXCELLENT and richly developed in flavor.  A+ on this one.  With a bit better noodle and shorter wait times, this place could easily be 5 stars.A haiku:Hipsters serve ramen.I wait far too long for it.It was worth the wait.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This is not the case.I could give this place a lower rating then I would. We came in wanting to treat my little cousin to a wonderful ramen experience and coming in was a let down. We were seated outside where we didn't even receive water just cups. I had to go in and ask for some water and that's when they realize that we were even out there waiting for service. Finally the hostess came back with hot water, so I asked if we could have some ice. She came back with 2 glasses of iced mugs ( there are 3 people in our party). The waiter came and he was rude with taking our order and he did even deliver our apps. The hot chicken buns were okay but not the best and so was the gyoza we had better and pay less for it. When we got our food from the waiter he slammed it down a day ran off. This waiter has no matters or personality to make guest wanting to come back. I do have to say the ramen was pretty tasty. But when we ask for a To go container for our ramen they gave us paper boxes that does hold ramen.  All in all we will not be back and I am really disappointed in  that fact that they have good ramen but everything else here sucks! :(\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our waitress rudely explained that they offer gf noodles for those that limit gluten as a \"life style choice,\" not for those with allergies.

The portions are large and everything is just top notch. We had the duck buns (I don't usually even eat duck and I absolutely loved them, could have eaten many more), as well as the Tennessee ramen and one of the donburis.  The broth in the ramen was rich, and just spectacular. I only had a few bites of the donburi, but it was so good that I might have to order it myself next time.

They charge 2 dollars for an add-on item and a dollar for a spice in a little container. The service was ok too I guess. The server forgot to bring out my girlfriend boiled egg which was 2 dollar. He also forgot our drinks we have to remind him to get the drinks. He disappeared most of the time, we waited about 10 minutes to get our check. The food was ok too. We ordered a regular miso noodles and a spicy miso noodles. The soup was really salty. I finished my bowl only because I didn't want to waste the food.

    "comments": "I can honestly say I've never witnessed such horrible FOH or service in my life. We were told a half hour wait..... Which turned into 45-50 minutes, which was fine, as they were very busy (even though they set at least 3 parties before us and we were told they didn't do reservations.... I'm still not sure how that seating system works.) However, the service after this was appalling.... Our water ran out and I had to actually ask the food runner for more water, then we ordered the Hot Chicken Buns (which I was excited to try because they had rave reviews) only for them to bring Duck Buns and to the wrong group.... I had high hopes (even after they told us they were out of the chicken and brought us duck) because they were quite good. Next I had the dumplings, which were disappointing and didn't taste like much of anything, the only flavor I got was the citrus in the sauce. Lastly I ordered the Tennessee Tonkotsu, to which I added an extra egg and a spice bomb at the suggestion of the server. When I received my ramen I was very disappointed at sip one.... It tasted like sesame and warm pork fat, the kind that my grandmother tosses because she's fried something in it and it's broken and gross. I added the spice bomb. Now I had sesame flavored spicy pork fat. I waited until I was able to grab our server (who was again very busy) and asked politely for some soy sauce. He stumbled on his words and gave me a story on how they may have a small bottle in the back. He asked me if I still wanted the soy and I said yes, then he continued by asking why I wanted it..... Um, what? Why does a server feel the need to ask why a customer would ask for a condiment? They had the option of add ins, which he had earlier recommended to us (a party of 4) so someone asking for soy sauce in an Asian place doesn't seem that absurd. I told him simply \"because it's not very flavorful\" he asked again and I added \"it just isn't very good\". He said he would see about the soy for me. This lead to a very long and awkward altercation over the soy... Which I never got because he told me they don't even make the ramen there and didn't have the soy to give me. Which is fine, whatever. Not my restaurant. However, he actually seemed offended that myself and my party weren't satisfied with our food and kept asking how to fix it, when I had told him a moment earlier how to fix it and he wasn't able. I sent my ramen back, because I wasn't going to finish it... Why waste the calories on something that isn't good? I still don't understand why he took it the way he did... I wasn't rude or upset with him at all. It wasn't anything to do with him personally, however his unwillingness to either 1. Fix the issue 2. Get a manager (which he did later) or 3. Drop the issue altogether makes me think he isn't a seasoned server. His skin is far too thin. After a long and drawn out discussion with my guest (which got a bit out of hand and heated, though I tried to end it several times, the server kept talking and asking questions) the manager came over (angry) and made the situation 100X worse. I wanted to crawl under the table. I've never been so disrespected or embarrassed in a food establishment in my life! I tried to end the argument between her, my guest, and toward the end (???) the guy seated next to our group but we basically were kicked out. It was horrible. All in all, the duck was the only positive thing I can say about this place, because they were good. Maybe they have buns to-go.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Okay, fine.  But I think it's ridiculous to charged $2.00 for 2-3 tablespoons of red hot paste.  If we were eating at a burger place would I have to pay for mustard and ketchup.  Give me a break.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Oh and their hot chicken is amazing, if you don't try it you are really missing out. I do think they should add the option to make your ramen spicy and have some options because the Korean hot sauce they offer is not hot at all. Today I experienced something strange while sitting at the bar, the lady sitting next to me didn't eat all her ramen and asked for a to go container and they refused...something about the owner saying ramen to go loses the food quality...the lady had to argue(nicely) and they gave in. If you eat in any restaurant and you want a to go container you should be warned it will ruin the food quality and politely given a container.

At least have one chicken Ramen bowl, or beef. There are many people who prefer not to eat Pork. All in all. The waitress was accommodating and put in extra veggies for us. Will visit again. Maybe try a rice bowl if they haven't changed their Ramen options.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Great Tonkotsu ramen!!! Otaku is actually my 2nd favorite ramen place that I've tried, and I've tried too many to remember! (My first is actually Ippudo in NY). My boyfriend and I were visiting Nashville and since it's kind of our mission to try every ramen place out, we just had to stop by. We began with the buns, which were actually a bit spicier than expected, but still good. Not amazing, but good. However, there was another issue with that. We specifically asked for no pickles but still got them. When we told the waiter that we actually asked for no pickles, he gladly took it back. But, because we were sitting at the bar we were able to see the reaction of one of the female food preps. She rolled her eyes and angrily picked out the pickles and threw them to the side and gave us the same one. I mean I could have done the same exact thing, I honestly thought those buns were perhaps meant for another party. And what if one of us were allergic to pickles? Her reaction just threw me off. But besides that everything was cool. Our server was phenomenal! He was super chill and friendly (and not the annoying type of friendly) which was perfect. I ordered the Tonkotsu and it was absolutely delicious. If you're in Nashville you need to visit this place!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The duck bun melts in your mouth, and the Tennessee Tonkatsu is the best in town. I wish the space was a little larger. With food this great, it gets packed, but the ramen is well worth rubbing elbows with your neighbor. Also, be sure to take advantage of the additions. The spice bomb adds a great extra kick. I do wish that they would expand the drink menu a tad, but I was content with my glass of cava. Overall, I wish I could add a half star to this review. This place really should be 4 1/2 stars.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

After dinner, we did enjoy ourselves out on the new \"no rush\" patio. But, they have unfortunately they have made some changes in hopes of becoming more of an authentic Japanese \"ramen house,\" which has proven to be extremely inconvenient. 1st- you now only have 30 minutes at your table, 15after you get your food before your \"time is up.\" 2nd they only serve 6 bowls at a time, so if you have 7 people in your party...sucks to suck. One will have to wait much longer for their ramen. 3rd- they no longer serve mixed drinks in the dining area, only beer and wine. You will have to go back to the bar to try one of their awesome drinks. 4th- if you have 7 people or over you have to sit in their bar area at the entrance... They will not seat you at a table. So forget facing each other for some good conversation.... Not that you have time for that anymore... All in all, great ramen, but the changes are too much.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Headed up here fro a nightcap after an insanely gluttonous meal downstairs at the Marsh House, and we were treated to a gorgeous 270 degree view of Nashville. You can clearly see the AT&T \"Battower\", and from there it's fun to try to orient yourself.The outside patio was gorgeous; I wish I could experience it's full majesty in the summer. As it was, we lurked out here longer than we should have even though it was SO COLD.I ordered a drink off their menu and was not a fan; should have stuck to my Old Fashioned! Partially my fault for deviating, but bartender recomended it when I told him I liked Bourbon.Wish the crowd was a bit more lively - felt oddly subdued for 10 pm - but I suppose it was a Thursday. Spoiled in LA with people out on every night, I suppose.Definitely a good place to hit if you're in the Gulch area in Nashville!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "First off, the Thompson Hotel is chic, trendy, and an interesting addition to the Gulch. L.A. Jackson is the bar that brings all of that to fruition in one location and I like it! I am a sucker for a view, and they have an incredible one. The bar itself has full, high windows that provide a great peek at the Nashville skyline, but the patio holds the wow factor. With chic patio furniture, a tree growing in the center, and an outdoor bar, it will be the go-to place to be seen Spring/Summer 2017! The first time I visited I had cocktails only and while interesting and different, I was more happy with my wine selection. I also sampled the food with some friends on my last visit and was impressed with the truffle fries, carbonara, venison poppers, and the charcuterie and cheese board. All of the food we sampled was delicious and a good portion for a group of 4. I probably wouldn't get the venison poppers again because it was bit rich, but they were still good, just not my preference. Our service when dining was a bit slow, but picked up a bit more once placed our food orders. Overall, I throughly enjoy the bar and lounge, and cannot wait to experience it with warmer weather!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's far too crowded these days and the crowd is... interesting. It's as though people are here because *other* people are supposed to be here. Does that make sense? The scene the space used to make feels far less authentic than it used to be. On a recent Saturday visit, I was shocked at how empty it was. Remember back months ago when there were lines to the lobby on weekdays. Additionally, the tax/tip trick that's going on with the wine/cocktail program is not a good look at all. Rather than incorporating tax into the drink price (as usual), you're getting hit with paying $16+ before tip for a $13 cocktail. Nope. No sir.

On top of that, these people are effing shady with their wine prices. Most places add the tax into the price on the menu - so when you pay $14 for a glass of wine it's because the taxes are stupid high for restaurants. Well, imagine ordering a $14 glass of wine and then you get your bill and it has an additional $4 tax on it. Add a tip and you just spend $20 for a glass of wine that probably cost $5. Super shady. Just because you're some fancy new trendy hotel with a rooftop bar doesn't mean it's ok to jack up prices like that. It's a shame really. The space is beautiful and I would love to enjoy a drink and meal here but I just can't. I won't ever go back. Low class establishment disguised as high class.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Incredible build out, roomy, large bar and lots of seating and a spacious outdoor rooftop area. Ah-mazing view- just incredible! Kept reminding myself this was Nashville. We came up here after dining at Marsh House and had a glass of wine and beer. We did try the broiled oysters, which were just ok. They didn't quite live up to the fresh oysters downstairs. The burger looked good, and they did have other bar bites that looked good. Menus change seasonly. The particular bartender we had was just ok, a tad arrogant, so wasn't wowed with service. Again, had great service downstairs, so maybe since this place upstairs was trendier, who knows. Apparently this place gets crazy busy at night, so I'm glad we went early. It was still very busy, but no lines or anything. Will definitely be back, and would definitely take out of towners here to showcase our beautiful \"It\" city.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I got to chat with Pop for a little bit, and he mentioned that he has all sorts of sauce and spice combinations in his arsenal, but he keeps it simple for the menu, because that's the kind of place he wants to run. I can appreciate that, but I hope he brings out more flavors in the future, maybe as a special or something! Just know that there is an apparent difference in size between party wings and jumbo wings, so order accordingly. We ordered the jumbo with the honey hot and lemon pepper. I also recommend getting the fried green tomatoes! They are killer!! There were desserts lined up by the counter, and I was super tempted to get a slice of cake. Also, if you're a Faygo drinker, they have that there too. :)But seriously, I cannot talk enough about how sweet Pop and his crew are.

No one had ever been to this place before but the reviews were good so we decided to give it a try. Are we glad we did!The staff was super friendly on the phone and suggested ways for us to order to save money. On our arrival I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the place was extremely clean and well run.The wings on the other hand surpassed my experience so far these were fantastic. I dare say there may be some of the best wings I've ever had. Too bad my relative is moving because we would definitely be coming back to this place again and again.Way to go pops, great job\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was hanging out with a couple of neighbors and they brought me here and let me tell ya, I'M GLAD THEY DID!!! This place is on a well driven part of Murfreesboro Rd and I had never seen it OR heard of it for that matter! I met Pop and my man, Tim along with the staff! They take pride in their craft and it shows in the food! My neighbor ordered the chicken thighs and they were DELICIOUS! The seasoning takes you back to Big Mama's house after church on Sunday! Without finishing that first bite, I was already ordering more! They were seasoned to perfection and just down right juicy! My other neighbor got the wings and talk about GOOD!?!?

We talk a little politics, we talk a little world affairs, we talk about the younger generation - talk, never argue - as it should be.My flavor of choice is the honey hot. I've had the hot, but never the suicide - just might one day. For me, I generally order a honey hot breast, thigh, French fries and an extra jalapeno. Oh, I also call in - takes time to make it fresh every time! For me it's kinda like going to a Chinese take out intending to try something new, but always get the same thing - that's how it is for me at Pop's.

    "comments": "This. Place. Is. AMAZING!!! General info about the restaurant:The restaurant is immaculately clean. The set up is open, allowing you to see into the kitchen for full transparency. The menu is appropriately varied to provide options for different cravings/tastes. The food is always fresh, hot, and deliciously seasoned. The service is friendly and prompt (given that everything is freshly made). And, of utmost importance, \"Pops\" himself is a great conversationalist and very friendly. He's been operating restaurants for over a decade, and it shows. I've visited this place three times now, and on each occasion, I've been delightfully pleased with my experience all around. Specific menu items I've tried:So far, I've tried two of the wing flavors, hot and honey gold, both were very good. The hot was quite hot for me, but my fiancé loved it (see, once again, something for every \"taste\"). I got the jumbo wings (as suggested by Pops). It's larger than the party wings, and the six-wing special (which comes with fries and a drink for $6.99 all day, every day) really does fill you up. (Just FYI, they are not whole wings.) The fries were really good too. They are just regular fries (as opposed to Rally's-type fries) sprinkled with Pop's seasoning blend. There is just enough seasoning on them that it won't impede your ability to use ketchup but provides you with enough flavor to forgo ketchup. I've also tried the rib tips which were very good as well. They were very tender and delicious. The BBQ sauce was Memphis style, sweet with flavorful spices, which complemented the ribs well. So, if you haven't figured it out already, I definitely recommend this place. They honestly have some of the best wings I've had in Nashville...and, trust me, I've tried a lot of wing joints.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and this place, along with the entire market, was humming. If you haven't been here yet you should know that Picnic Tap is not a brewery, but is the next best thing: a bright and airy watering hole that has a laser focus on local beers on draft - with 15 - yes 15 taps being rotated frequently.  The nice thing is we were able to try many of the new offerings from Nashville brewers via PT's tasters and then we can take a growler home or plan a visit to their tasting room.  I see on their chalkboard there are nights that focus on one brewers offerings, with free swag and visits from the brewers during their night.  During our stop we saw many hot dogs come off the grill that looked real yummy.  I can't comment as we didn't partake, but based on the volume of dogs being served they must be something special!Overall experience and service was great at Picnic Tap - I enjoy when the bar keeps know the beer and offer you tastes before you commit to that special pint(s)!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Brussell sprouts and fried cauliflower were delicious. Sunchokes were sliced thin and drenched in oil. No flavor. Main courses were all disappointing. Ricotta Gnudi consisted of 5 small balls, dry and flavorless. Snapper was very undercooked. Pink and raw. Baby chicken [less than 28 days old] was dry and flavorless. Duck breast needed salt & pepper but by the time the waiter came back for us to ask for this, the duck was cold. Dessert was slightly better but the lava cake was overcooked. Coconut tart was tasty.Overall I can just say wow. I usually expect this from a hotel restaurant,  but this Hutton restaurant has always delivered higher standards until tonight. No longer a trusted option for business dinners.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So I've been thinking of this review since we went, because I want to give an honest and fair assessment. We went for the Christmas Pre Fixe dinner and we're both genuinely looking forward to it. We were greeted and sat very quickly in a comfortable setting. I was sitting on the bench along the window, which the cushion was very plush and comfortable - but I was right in the middle of two cushions, so we had to move our table over by about a foot on our own - which was not awesome for the table next to us and we apologized to them. We ordered drinks and the server came back letting us know that they were out of one of the key ingredients for it, so we had to order something else. Okay....I tried one of their holiday cocktails and it ended up not being how the server described it and not very enjoyable, so I sent that back and exchanged it for an old stand by. So we're already struggling with the bar. Bread and pimento cheese ball with crackers came out. The cheese ball was phenomenal. Light, airy, delicious. Loved every bite of it. The bread was stale. I brought it to the manager's attention and she replaced it with fresh bread and thanked me more letting her know so that batch wouldn't go out to other tables. Shouldn't someone in the kitchen be checking these things? In any case, the fresh bread was quite wonderful. Fluffy little clouds of deliciousness that paired nicely with the cheese ball. We both got the shaved Brussel sprout salad which was on point. Perfectly dressed, serving size was just right and it tasted lovely. Very enjoyable experience there. I ordered the prime rib and since I rarely eat red meat nowadays, I ordered it medium since I'm unable to eat red meat at a colder temperature. My husband got adventurous and went with the duck confit. When they both came out, they began to place my dish in front of me and it was so rare that it was still mooing. So I told them no, I ordered it cooked medium and sent that back to be warmed up. In the meantime, my husband is eating his dinner and I'm taking bites off his plate. The duck was quite delicious. The accompaniments - mieh. They were both sweet, so there was this sweet element to the savory duck. Probably a chef thing, but we weren't into it. By the time he was just about done, mine finally came back. So I didn't actually get to eat with my husband, we both watched each other eat. Once cooked to requested temperature, the prime rib was delicious. The char on it was perfection. Speaking of char, they advertised charred carrots on the menu with it and one carrot was raw and the other carrot was boiled - not charred - but at least cooked. The Yorkshire pudding was delicious and contained a generous portion of gravy. Mushroom gravy to be exact. It didn't say mushrooms on the menu and I absolutely detest mushrooms. I hate the smell, I can't stand the texture. Ugh. So I found myself pushing my way through what was otherwise a delicious gravy to try and avoid mushrooms, but a couple of them landed in my mouth, which for me is the opposite of enjoyable. But there are people out there that love mushroom gravy and if you are one of them - you would most likely really appreciate this gravy. Once finished, we waited a little long, but nothing obnoxiously long. I did notice that the table next to us that sat down after us got their desserts before us, but thought they were probably running ahead of us at this point because of my meat being undercooked. That's when our server came to drop the check and we had to remind her we ordered dessert. She seemed surprised we didn't get it yet, said she would make sure they were on their way - and still dropped the check. I've been to my fair share of high end restaurants and it's quite out of sorts to drop the check before a table has completed their meal. The server should also know exactly what is going on with their tables at all times - it's clear she didn't. Checks should not be dropped until the meal has completely concluded and all dishware cleared, so we found it off putting that the check was dropped ahead of the desserts. My husband got the Yule long, which he really enjoyed. I got the toffee pudding, which I thought was quite delicious. When we were cashing out, we noticed a 20% gratuity had already been added to the check - which we missed that detail somehow. Maybe it was on the menu and we just didn't see it? Not really sure. We ended up dropping a little over 2 bills on dinner. When you are in the price range of $100+ a head, you better be on point in all areas. I NEVER send things back and if you're a restaurant in this price range, a patron should have no reason to send anything back. The server was also very loose - too loose - in her conversation with us and treating us like we were her buddies rather than customers paying a high price at the door. She needs to have more composure with customers at this price point. In all, it wasn't bad - they just weren't on point\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was just bad.  I tried with the pancakes.  I took four or five bites, but decided it wasn't worth the calories to keep eating.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his egg plate, which looked good.  The restaurant manager did come over at the end of our meal for feedback.  Maybe someone alerted him to my entire uneaten plate coming back to the kitchen?  He ended up comping my pancakes, so that was nice.  They care, and that's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It didn't seem to be a big issue ultimately because it never got particularly busy in the 5:30 hours. I'll be honest, I was hoping to avoid the \"Pre Fee\" (Prix Fixe) menu, but alas it was not to be.I know 1808 Grille is just following Game Theory when it, along with everyone else, offers these high priced meals on Valentine's Day but it makes me sad. More so because the better half's BIRTHDAY is Valentines Day. I'd be a real cad to not take her out on her Birthday AND Valentine's day just because of \"Prix\". In any case, the food, with the exception of the disgustingly bitter \"Winter Greens\" salad was really good and our waitress was very attentive.The location and the dinner were romantic and I would recommend it to anyone looking for similar.  They are on OpenTable so you can book in advance, but don't expect to escape the Prix Fixe like I did.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

DIE. FOR.  I left wishing I had an additional to-go order.  If you are on West End, please visit this beautiful establishment and its wonderful staff for lunch or dinner.  If you're not hungry just sit at the bar and have their Woodford bourbon flight (our after dinner treats...a true Kentuckian's dessert).  IMO, they are not charging enough for the Weller under the current circumstances.  =)   Enjoy!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They were so wonderful and placed us in a table where we could exchange gifts. EB was awesome. This was a very good experience. The food was really good and prices were fair. The cushions on the booth were very soft and cushy. That's a good thing unless you're in the middle and trying to scoot around. I survived. We will be back.

So yummy. I also tried the short rib which was sweet and rib shreds just melted. So yum! Mac N Cheese was warm and cheesy, french fries were thin and greasy, but I like them like that! Sides were like normal sides, the hot chicken and the short rib are a must try. I don't remember if I had sorbet or gelato, (I really don't know the difference because I'm a classic ice cream kinda dude) it was cafe latte flavor and it was okay!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Wow.  This restaurant is fantastic.  My husband and I spent a good hour discussing where we were going to go for our final night vacation dinner and through Foursquare and Yelp, we found the 1808 Grille.  Through pages and pages of recommendations and suggestions, we finally found our restaurant... and it was only a $6 cab ride (or 5 minutes) from our hotel in the Midtown neighborhood.This place was DE-LICIOUS.  Like incredibly good.  Like the food was so good that we were talking about how good it was during our meal.  I am incredibly impressed with the quality of the food and the service that we experienced at 1808... especially the food.  We started our meal with the cauliflower Caesar salad and it was delish.  The cauliflower was perfectly cooked so it was al dente but not too crispy or raw tasting and that was mixed in with romaine shreds and a homemade Caesar dressing that was outrageously good.  Served with a parmesan crisp, as if it weren't good enough.   We were very happy with the choice.I ordered the chicken \"pot pie\" and my husband ordered the braised short rib.  I was so, so happy with the choice that I made.  Even from the first bite, the gravy and vegetables and chicken were perfectly seasoned.  The \"pot pie\" was a roll of puff pastry placed on top of the dish, which looked good and tasted delicious.  I broke it up and mixed it in the chicken and gravy and was very, very happy.  My husband's short rib was literally melt-in-your-mouth good and he ate almost the whole thing, which is rare since he has a small appetite.  Eating the whole meal is a testament to how good the food really was.  We had a side of horseradish mashed potatoes which were served in a tiny saucepan, which was cute.  They were nicely mashed (not pureed) and the horseradish was a nice touch.  We were stuffed but ordered dessert anyway because the dinner was so absolutely good and we were not disappointed.  I got the banana pudding and it was well worth it.  Chilled with a lot of bananas and homemade vanilla cookies, it was a great way to top off the meal.  Other reviewers said to order the donuts and my husband LOVED them.  There was a selection of three that included chocolate, fruit, and butter and they were delicious.  Again, my husband almost never finishes anything and he gobbled the donuts up.  Super tasty.  Go here.  The service was good, the restaurant wasn't packed (even on a Saturday at 8ish) and the food was AMAZING.  The menu changes four times a year, so if I lived in Nashville I'd go that often just to see what the chef is offering with seasonal ingredients and flavors.  The prices were reasonable and everything was really great.  Looks like there's street parking and valet available, but cab it so you don't have to hassle.  Also, check out the lobby of the Hutton hotel.  It smells AMAZING with some kind of air freshener that is piped through the vents (literally true, I asked).  Again, go here.  Well worth coming to this seemingly out-of-the-way venue (in terms of downtown) and well worth eating here more than once a year, just to sample the new menu items.  Since my in-laws are moving to Nashville, I will DEFINITELY be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I stay in hotels pretty often and come hell or high water, I do whatever it takes to not eat in their affiliated restaurants. I'm also one of those rare souls that actually doesn't like room service. 1808 changes all that, though, and I would even go so far as to say I'd enthusiastically eat (and drink-- lovely bar area!) here even if I wasn't staying at my beloved Hutton Hotel. Similar to the superb customer service at the Hutton, 1808 goes above and beyond what you'd expect to accommodate their customers with a tempting menu that they are able to adjust for various diets. There are always vegetarian options. There are always vegan options. They change seasonally along with rest of the menu (ever notice how some restaurants have the perpetual butternut squash ravioli, even when that stuff isn't in season? Are you bored with butternut squash ravioli as much as I am?)Come breakfast time, I'm happily accommodated with a non dairy milk option for my latte. Come lunch time, there's vegetable entrees-aplenty. I love their quinoa dish of the season, but I recently opted for one of the main dishes that came along with three glorious sides. As this dish changes seasonally, all I will tell you is to trust them. They do magical things with vegetables, my friends.Finally, did you know they have their own signature batch of bourbon? Oh it's true and yes, I sampled it, despite not being a brown liquor kinda girl. It's smooth & smoky and best sipped neat.Before ending this review, I must tip my hat to the servers. They are the best! They will go out of their way to make your visit sublime.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They said that they got a new chef and he wanted a change. Here is some advice-don't try to fix what isn't broken. That burger was unique and delicious! The server was lame in trying to tell us that the new Hutton burger was basically the same as the 1808 burger minus the slaw and thousand island and with better cheese. Uuuhhh nooo, it isn't. Same meat that is all. The service is declining there as well. They are slow to come to the table initially and to bring the check when it is time. There are only maybe 5-7 tables with seatings  for lunch so I don't understand the poor service. The prices  are increasing. $16.00 for a hamburger.  They think a lot of their average or below average new burger. It is not the same place as a year ago and with taking their saving grace off the menu, there is no coming back. As a local who chooses to  eat here for lunch since the hotel opened, I am sorry to say that this was my last time to eat here and I will not be recommending it to anyone-unless they bring the 1808 back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

When we arrived at the Marriott Residence Inn, we asked the Desk Clerk to assist us in getting a reservation for supper. Since it was last minute and everything was booked, we were totally at the mercy of availability. The 1808 Grill was next door and had vacancies so we booked a reservation for 7:00pm. We arrived on time, were pleasantly greeted and immediately seated. It wasn't crowded and there were a few empty tables. The service was great and the food was good. The menu selection was a \"Valentine's Special\". Appetizer, salad, main entrée and a small \"shared\" dessert for $75 each. We enjoyed the meal, the ambiance was ok, but, they tried to give us the appetizer for the table next to us, the price was over the top and the 20% tip being automatically added we were not pleased. We do realize the timing was not good but I have marked this off my list and recommendations are not probable. Sorry.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My friend ordered shrimp and grits and I ordered soup variety. What we got was essentially the classiest and most flavor balanced (as in not overly butter tasting) shrimp and grits that was elegantly displayed. Whereas too often soups are too salty, or over flavored, it was perfect (and normally pork and seafood don't go well together).Yes the portions were small, but they came with with add on of sauteed vegetables, olives, and etc. Oh and the breadsticks (not traditional breadsticks) were to die for.So yes... this is a perfect place for a date OR go with your parents (it was an older crowd that was there) for some quality dining that isn't as pricey (but still decently pricy - as in going towards the 3 Dollar category vs just 2) or ridiculous as fine dining and still a cultural experience. Definitely not the cookie cutter hotel dining experience I thought it would be\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My fiance and I live in Nashville and this has sort of become our go to place for celebrations. We tried 1808 based on a listing of the best restaurants in Nashville and have returned a number of times (the most recent being last night). We just love 1808 Grille, for a couple reasons. The first would be the food. They completely change the menu on a seasonal basis, which is cool, but you can pretty much count on everything being unique and consistently amazing. I will say that we've only been to 1808 for dinner, so I don't know how their other meals are, but dinner is fabulous! The second reason would be the attentiveness shown by the staff. Everyone there is wonderful, and I do mean everyone, from Chef Jake Strang to the wait staff. The people at 1808 Grille really care that their guests have a wonderful experience in their restaurant; this level of customer service is something that is often lacking at other places. Every time we've been there the experience has felt so special, and it's been because the staff has made sure we feel personally cared for. I can't say enough wonderful things about 1808 Grille; I highly recommend it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "With an upscale twist on Southern classics, 1808 Grille did not disappoint. We had a very friendly server, and the rest of the staff was very attentive, not letting our water glasses get less than half full at any point during our meal. We started with seared tuna, which sat atop an avocado-cranberry mixture. It sounds strange, but the cranberry gave the tuna a new flavor that really worked, and the tuna could not have been any fresher as it was flown in from Hawaii today. For my entree, I had Hot Chicken, and it was the most juicy and tender chicken I have ever had. The spice level was mild (I would have preferred it kicked up a notch or three), and it was served over bacon with crispy kale strips on top. My Mom had the special, which was the most delectable lightly fried trout topped with a sweet and spicy Thai chili sauce. I admit to entree envy, although my chicken was great. The sides came served for the table and were a farrow salad, mango and kiwi chutney and spicy cremini mushrooms. I loved the mushrooms and chutney while my Mom's favorite was the farrow.  Too full to try desserts, the pink lemonade sorbet was tempting, so maybe I'll leave some room in my stomach for it the next time.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "For the price (okay not just the price) this place was utterly disappointing. At first glance the restaurant looked great. Good atmosphere and decent service.  Even the appetizer - calamari - was good. Nice alteration on a predictable classic. Then came the entrees...I don't have an eloquent way of saying this.  It literally looked like crap (see photos). And not one dish, but two. This will be the standing joke of the weekend for months to come. I couldn't even finish my dish. I had the trout which in theory sounded delicious  but in practice was over sauced and lack-luster.  I have never seen two dishes with so many varieties of brown, visually and taste-wise. We will not be going back to this restaurant any time soon, or for that matter ever. There are so many better places to eat in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's very neutral and although the layout is well done it's just blah.Unfortunately, everything about this place was 'blah\". The staff was nice but \"meh\". I had the Open-Faced Crab Cake sandwich. This is some of the most bland food I've ever had to pay for. Let me at least say that the crab cake had quality meat in it, but it had no life! And the rosemary focaccia it sat on didn't even taste like rosemary. The spinach salad it came with could have been presented a little better but it tasted ok. Honestly, it just wasn't worth the price to me.Overall, I think this is a place older people would like to frequent. The decor is nice and completely unoffensive, and the food has little spice.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Our server forgot to bring our drinks to the table; though he was very personable. Food was pretty good. Pumpkin soup had nice flavor. Although, $31 for 3 scallops was not worth the price.

It was definitely too heavy of a choice for dinner, as I needed a nap after. The fries came out in the fryer basket. Yum. They were like those tiny little punk fries you get from steak-n-shake, only smaller. They burger was SO GOOD. The over all feel of the place was \"expensive\" and it was a little too quiet in there.

    "comments": "When your friend is moving back home after going to school in Nashville for a few years and decides he wants his last meal in town to be the hamburger from 1808 Grille at the Hutton Hotel you tag along and order the hamburger! I loved the decor in the hotel and in the restaurant. Very chic. What I loved even more was how friendly the staff was. Usually when you walk into a place of this caliber in Los Angeles the staff can be stuck up and at times intimidating, but here it was the complete opposite. I guess I need to remember that people are kind in the South. Even though it wasn't on the menu we were able to order the infamous $10 burger. It was huge and served with crispy garlicky fries! I was a little apprehensive when he mentioned it had cole slaw, but I trusted him and just went with it as did everyone else at our table and we all agreed that it was fantastic! If you want to save a few bucks come during happy hour when the burger & fries are half price! You can't even get a burger & fries for $5 up the street at Five Guys! The wait staff was very attentive to our six person table and instantly was tending to the blinds to block out the sun that was shinning in our eyes and the waiter voluntarily offered to give us all separate checks and was more than happy to do it. Actually, this was the case in almost every place we dinned in Nashville. Coming from Los Angeles that is shocking because here waiters and waitresses aren't always pleasant about having to split checks.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "As a rule, I never eat at a hotel's restaurant. Maybe I've been brainwashed to think there's something wrong with eating at a hotel restaurant, but I've also never stayed at a place like Hutton Hotel. However, I made the exception during a stay at this hotel after hearing such good reviews. I went in for breakfast and the food, along with the table service, won me over. I had an amazing poached egg dish with grits. It was good not just because of taste (which of course is the most important thing), but also because of the way that the dish was prepared and presented (and dare I say this, not wanting to sound pretentious, the way it was conceptualized). You could tell that there is a high standard to which the kitchen staff pushes food out to the dining area and that a lot of thought was put into the design of the menu. The hostess who sat me down at my table and the waiter who took my order were both pleasant and elevated the whole dining in experience. If you are staying at Hutton Hotel, the breakfast is worth it at 1808 Grille. You'll have a good experience, no doubt.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I spent the entire day in the lovely Hutton Hotel and visited this onsite restaurant not once, but twice.  Yep, that's twice..once for lunch and once for dinner.  I'm typically wary of hotel restaurants, but have to admit this one was pretty good. During a working lunch our party of 10 enjoyed their private room, which even had a TV that we were able to use for a presentation.  I started my meal with the corn gazpacho (eh) and then followed it up with the flat bread (yum). And my colleague was sweet enough to share her fries that came with my burger.When I stopped back in later that night for dinner I decided to get my own fries and burger. I'm usually not a burger type of girl, but this one was so good!The lunch service was a little on the slow side, but they were on their game during dinnertime, which allowed me plenty of time to get to the airport and head back to the fam.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Even though 1808 sits just a few blocks away from the Vandy campus, I never think of it as a lunch option which is just cray-cray because I love the hotel. I finally cleaned of my glasses and saw the Hutton just sitting there while my friend and I were pondering where to have lunch around campus without the campus chaos. What a great choice.I was worried that we would need resevations, but at 1 on a Tuesday, the was lots of space. And what a space it is. For the solo diners/TV watchers the bar offers tables and straight up bar service whereas the restaurant has nice plushy couches and tables. I had a moment of panic that the (grumpy!) hostess was going to put me in a table right by another one when were plenty of open spaces but scored a table for 6 (!!) with a couch.The service was happier than the hostess and was totally fine with me waiting with wine for my friend who was running late.  (Note to my Yelp buddies: it wasn't busy! I'm not a table hog!) The lunch menu wasn't what you would call 'vast'. There were burgers, snappy sandwiches and some 'big' eats of steaks you could have if that's your thing. Both my friend and I got a roasted califlower cesar salad with steak which was good, but not great. The salad was overdressed drowning out the vegetables and the steak was too dry but it was not bad, just not awesome. On the food, I would give it a 3 stars, but I would go up to 4 stars because the wine by the glass was awesome, they had free valet for diners, free WiFi which was super handy while I waited, and a nice staff. The space itself is spectacular. Two glasses of wine, two lunch salads and a flat bread was $60 which was good, but hitting in that same price point with Etch's fresh flavors a few weeks ago makes the food here disappoint. Bottom Line: A great option away from campus to set up and work while having a burger and enjoy friendly service. I'd steer away from their adventure food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "*Regional Week 2012 Review*The atmosphere is lovely, and the location (inside the Hutton Hotel) can't be beat. We were in one of the private rooms, which I would recommend for any sort of business meeting or event, and everyone was very helpful. They offer their own version of local staple meat and threes. From there, you select one meat and the threes are set and seasonal. I did have a bite of the she crab soup and it was, far and away, the best thing I had. Probably the best thing on the menu period.The food left a bit to be desired, but I mean it when I say 'a bit'. It was frustratingly close to being really good. I opted for one of their versions of meat and threes. I selected the arctic char, and the threes that day were the Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and squash. Everything was decent, but each bite needed 'love'. I opted for the char because it seemed like the lightest option of the meats, but when it was served (skin on and skin up, which I'm not used to) atop about a half cup of crème fresh. Between the skin and the crème, it was much richer than I had hoped for.Onto the threes: The squash was simply not good. It was very tough and did not have a good flavor, as though it should have been par boiled in salt before being roasted. The Brussels sprouts were huge, even though they were halved, the halves were as big as some whole ones I've had, which made them a little hard to eat. The mashed potatoes were good with a bit of cheddar throughout, but against the richness of the fish, even a few bites was too much.I don't claim to be a food critic; that's not what I do. But I know enough about cooking and enough about eating to know that this was a good menu, full of good ideas and nice ingredients, but when it was all added up, it was a few beats off. I'd be happy to try it again, when I'm lucky enough to get back to Nashy!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Finally when the table was ready, we had to ask the hostess to sit- she never offered. She was extremely rude and unfriendly. Finally after we say down, The server moved at snail pace to take just our drink order. 20 minutes later our mimosas arrived and we finally got our bread basket 10 minutes after that. So with 11:30 reservations it took 30 minutes to get our first drink. It took so painfully long that we got the check and left immediately . Not worth your time unless you are wanting a 3 hour meal. Needless to say we will never go back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Not gonna lie, I came here having specifically picked it out after having heard from a chef that it has one of the best burgers in Nashville. I'd say that's about right, and it's exactly what I've had both times!The burger is actually cooked medium, and the meat feels more high quality than that at other places. Why does everyone love that place in east nashville? This is a far better burger, at 1-3 dollars more. And the fries are much better too, yes, even better than those tater tots. The flavor on the meat mixed with the carefully picked out mix of toppings is decadent, and the short, thin garlic fries that come with complement it beautifully. I would make the bun a bit more stiff though, since as tasty as it is, it kind of falls apart with the force I grab my burger..... ha.Overall, best burger in Nashville. But I would say it's cooked a tiny bit better at dinnertime.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The burger itself was cooked well. However, the dressing and slaw was a hot mess. Was sloppy and seemed like the burger was dependent on the dressing to be fabulous, but ended up sub-par. My hubby and I shared it and couldn't even  finish our half of the burger... The fries however were tasty and crispy and worth it. Next day, gave them another chance... Ordered the meat and 3 with flank steak. Although cooked well, Meat was chewy - very chewy. The 3 sides were just ok... I sent the meal back and ordered the Thai salad which was YUMMY! But they still charged me for the flank steak. $15 Bad business practice. IMO seems the cook lost their passion and the waitstaff just didn't care. Atmosphere was good but food just so-so. Go somewhere else, Nashville has so much more to offer and is full of GREAT food!!! Just not this place. Sorry.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Ok first, WHO KNEW?!!We ended up at the 1808 after hearing about their Masa Cake with seitan (Thanks Marcia M!). My two vegan companions ordered that and I got the scallops. (I'm not going to spend much time talking about the main dishes, beyond just to say they were all incredible.) They had really tasty breadsticks on the table for abating your early hunger and came out with a gorgeous array of olives as well. nom.As soon as the waiter saw I had even a glint in my eye about getting a glass of wine, he offered me a sample *wink* and said that he'd be happy to keep getting me samples until I knew. So I decided to take him up on his offer and ended up trying 4 different white wines (a glass worth collectively which he was fine with) and then got a glass of the 3rd I'd tried (the Sokol Blosser Evolution). The sommelier was wandering around and chatting with the guests as well, so if I'd had some serious questions about wine I could have asked him. One of the main things we were curious about here were the veggie sides. I got the spinach, chard, and escarole saute (vegan) along with the sweet potato rutabaga mash (not vegan). My brother got the 500 degree roasted oyster mushrooms (vegan). The red cabbage and apples were also vegan, but I can't remember about the rice pilaf.Believe me when I say these were some of the best veggies I have ever had in my life. The sauteed greens were beyond amazing, one of those dishes that you eat really slowly and spread out so you can enjoy it for as long as possible. And the mash was incredible. BUT the icing on the cake, the side dish to rival all side dishes, was hands down the oyster mushrooms. Cremini, George. I could eat this every day for the rest of my pescatarian life. Somehow the intense heat they cook them in just brings out every damned flavor the mushrooms ever thought to impart. And it is glorious. In my future I see many returns to 1808, likely with meals assembled entirely from side dishes. As someone who eats mostly vegetarian, I am not above this, and have found that some of my best meals have been had at steak houses where the asparagus and spinach are cooked perfectly. 1808 was no different. The size of the sides were generous and served in little metal pots which kept them warm. Because I chose a mid-plate for my main dish, I had just enough room for the sides. We didn't try the desserts, mostly because the only vegan offering was sorbet (isn't that always the way?), and I didn't want to torture my companions with my tasty treat. For a non-vegan restaurant, they are undoubtedly on the right path and definitely worth trying. I'd say that if they could add one more vegan dish and a vegan dessert, then they'd have my vote for best in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I ordered the same meal each time - the Arctic Char, which comes with three \"field to table\" sides. The sides change daily and none are printed on the menu. The first time I visited, my meal was served with a heavenly side of field peas, cabbage, and potatoes. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned and cooked... It was so yummy, I decided to order the exact same meal the next time around. On this particular day the sides were roasted potatoes, red cabbage, and some kind of Asian noodle dish. The potatoes and the cabbage were OK, but very bland. The noodles were crunchy and did not seem to fit with the meal. I love the atmosphere and I already have lunch reservations to eat there again in two days... I'm eating with a group, so they made us place our orders in advance... Hoping to get another 5 star char, but we'll see what it's served with Monday. Overall, I would recommend 1808 Grille to friends and clients without hesitation.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

No more jerky dude behind the bar = much happier experience. Switch to a glass of wine instead of the the cocktail-that-shall-remain nameless...much, much better. Bonus points to the barman for suggesting a lovely glass of red at the end of a long day, keeping me stocked with bar mix, checking in on me, and giggling at the heavily madeup/hairsprayed former Miss (insert Southern state here) who kept blinding us with her Blackberry flashed duckface self-portraits. I almost offered to take her a nice photo with my iPhone, but the glass of wine had me feeling so rosy posy that I decided to chill out and just enjoy...1808 is very stylish...and after enjoying 3 very good lunches here with my team...very on top of things. The food is nothing that will blow you away, but it is certainly well done, and presented. I highly suggest the butternut squash soup with duck confit, turkey panin and crabcake open face sandwich. All were very up to par. I'll avoid late at night, and won't order anything with gin....but as far as lunch, breakfast and a happy hour glass o' wine?

    "comments": "Wow. Oh wow!I was thoroughly impressed with my lunch experience today at 1808 Grille especially when I nibbled on their savory vegan offering of Masa Cake ($15.50). The contrasting combination of chili lime seared seitan with pickled red onion, mizuna, edamame, and ancho vinaigrette was a flavor explosion on my palate. Not exaggerating! Is it wrong that I could go back and nosh on the same plate again for dinner? I wouldn't have to though because the chef is very experimental with vegetarian/vegan cooking and is available to whip up something inspiring at your request. Don't get 1808 Grille confused with being just a mundane hotel bar & restaurant. This dining establishment has it's own identity and you will learn that very quickly when you experience it.TIP#1: Fantastic lunch option as it is centrally located and parking is validated.TIP #2: Every Wednesday from 6-7pm, 1808 Grille hosts a wine tasting for $15 that includes 4 premium wines and appetizers.

It doesn't make too much sense to wax poetic about specific dishes since they change seasonally, but I can tell you that 1808 Grille goes beyond the chicken/steak/pork/veg littany that we see on so many menus of restaurants in this price range. I can also say that I have had parsnip soup there several times that was fantastic. Also, (at least 6 months ago when I last went) their policy is to serve daily special vegetables with the large plates. There were three different ones, each served in a mid-sized iron bowl. Those along with the entreés created an incredible amount of food to consume, and I am a girl who has been known to pack it away!1808 Grille is a perfect compliment to the beautiful Hutton Hotel, but it has always been a great option for a weekend meal or drinks (when you don't want to wait at the Patterson House)  for this local.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "1808 Grille sets itself apart from a diner by offering delicious coffee. This is where the service stops. My friend and I were visiting Nashville for plain tourism. One thing I need to remember is that when I travel I need to recognize that all kinds of people are writing reviews on Yelp. 1808 Grille wasn't terrible food. It was average food served in a formal atmosphere. Perhaps it's more about the ambiance than the creativity with which the food is prepared, when it comes to the kinds of people who tour Nashville.Unless you're counting Kansas, Nashville was my first experience with the south.  What do you think the first thing was that I looked for? You guessed it, Southern Hospitality.  If you are a Nashville waiter serving food in a restaurant where most of your customers are hotel clients; then why wouldn't management factor this into their service ethic? I am not saying I know anything about the food-service industry; but all I am saying is that I was looking for it. Our waiter was polite, but he came across as burnt out and had no desire to make small talk. He asked me if I wanted the newspaper, and he comes back with the Wall Street Journal. I am a former reporter. I want to see the local newspaper. I am not interested in a publication out of New York while I am vacationing in Nashville. Seriously? It only made me mad when I tried to tease him about it and he immediately brushed it off with a sense of, \"Lady, I have other things to do, and no time to entertain your playful banter.\" Oh really? The restaurant was not even busy! I'm telling you, this guy was not hospitable at all. If doctors have to work on a bedside manner; then it should stand to reason that waiters should adhere to a certain demeanor as well. I got the breakfast burrito, and my friend got poached eggs on corn bread.  I liked how my burrito was encased in a tortilla that was somehow fused together so that it didn't unravel while you ate it. What I didn't like was how bland it was. I understand that restaurants try to please everyone's sensitive preferences; but I definitely did not like how the pico de gallo, hot sauce, and sour cream were all served on the side in stainless steel measuring cups.  My friend's breakfast was clearly the better choice. The poached eggs were not only on top of corn bread, but there were layers of ham and spinach, which added nutrition and a lovely color to the dish.  On the side he got skillet-style potatoes.  I did not taste his meal; but he seemed to like it. However, I did not get a \"wow\" out of him either. If I visit Nashville again, I will not eat here. The staff was either way too positive to the point where you could tell it was shallow; or they were too mechanically polite with no ability for small talk. Coupled with the merely decent breakfast; I just feel like there are better places to explore.  To the Hutton Hotel, you might want to reconsider who is managing your restaurant. Perhaps have the chef redesign the breakfast menu. The menu also read a little snooty when I noticed the asterisk at the bottom, pointing out that substitutions were not an option. At least remove the breakfast burrito.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I feel like 3 stars makes it look like I didn't enjoy 1808 and I really did - I'm just not sure it was special enough overall that I'll go back often given the wealth of other amazing eating options in Nashville.The one thing that I might return for is the hot chicken - my friend ordered it at the waiter's suggestion. She was skeptical about upscale hot chicken and I normally stick to pescetarianism, but she went with it and I tasted it and it was fantastic. Definitely not your typical Nashville hot chicken but in a really good way. The cocktail I ordered (North of Manhattan) was also very good. And the service (our waiter was named Ben) was incredible.Everything else was just fine but not spectacular. I ordered the monkfish (also at the waiter's suggestion) and it was good but not especially memorable. They brought 3 free sides with our entrees (which was unexpected and awesome), but two of them were not delicious (the 3rd, mashed potatoes, were good). We took the waiter's suggestion for dessert too, and got the smores, a very good final bite.Overall, dinner took about 2 hours - this was actually a plus for my friend and me because we like a leisurely dinner, but worth mentioning for people looking for a faster dining experience (it was definitely not crowded when we were there).\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Visited 1808 Saturday before a TPAC performance.  I was kind of auditioning the place because my boss was coming to town this week and we'd be having business lunches while visiting customers in the medical district.  1808 would be a perfect place for such a lunch.  Plus, they have handy valet which I love at lunchtime.  On this particular Saturday we arrived at noon and the restaurant was pretty slow.  I'm guessing the \"too-hovery\" service was because of that.   Two guys stopping in a lot asking the same questions...that kind of thing.  The food was really just OK.  I had the mixed green salad with Atlantic Char and my friend had the Thai Chicken Salad...fine but either of us commented on our dishes.  The manager inquired if we were staying at the hotel.  I told him no, that we were local and he gave us both a card for BOGO on our next visit because they \"love their locals\".  That was nice...but I think I'll only use it if 1808 is a convenient choice, I would not rush back for the food.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "While planning a trip to Nashville I wanted to take my fiance out to a nice dinner, so I composed a list of restaurants and narrowed it down to 1 in the end. 1808 Grille won out and we were both very pleased with every aspect of our dining experience!Our server was very helpful and answered any questions we had, and his suggestions were helpful when we were being indecisive. There are a lot of food options, so no one should have a problem finding a dish they like. We ordered the scallops as an appetizer - delicious, they melt in your mouth. And then we had the steak and salmon for dinner, both tasted excellent and were cooked perfectly. The side items they brought out were great too (except the cheesy grits, but we don't like grits at all.) Even better than our meal though - dessert! After being told how popular the banana beignets were we knew we had to try them. They were amazing! No wonder every table around us had ordered them as well. If you're not a banana fan these might change your mind.I loved the atmosphere, the decor, the food, everything about this place and we will definitely be back! We've even talked about staying at the Hutton Hotel during our next visit.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Hutton is a class act and the 1808 Grille does its part keeping it classy.Our original plan today was to try Marche Artisan Foods in East Nashville for brunch. So I called over to Marche to ask if they took reservations and if there was wait. They did not take reservations and there was apparently a 30-45 minute wait.Yikes. Plan B - They do take reservations and there was no wait.Roll up 30 minutes later, warm welcome from both the valet (which is complimentary with validation from 1808 Grille) and equally warm welcome from Holly the hostess who had already selected a lovely corner table for us.Our waitress Mary was fantastic - honest, funny and extremely helpful. When I asked where they got the challah bread for their french toast, she went on a personal quest and got me the name and phone number of the supplier. Five stars for Mary!Speaking of the French toast with a berry maple sauce - phenomenal and reasonably priced at $9+.My wife was very pleased with her crab cake sandwich, which came with a spicy fried pickle. We were allowed to substitute potato salad instead of french fries. The potato salad was tasty with fancy multi-colored potatoes, but when another table of diners ordered burgers and fries, the enticing garlicky aroma of the fries wafting over made us sort of regret the substitution. As an appetizer, I tried a chilled tomato soup, which Mary candidly admitted was a divisive item on the menu. I took a chance nonetheless and ended up on the side of those who really liked the soup - so refreshing on a hot day, very fresh flavors, nice crunch from jicama and a creamy dollop of sour cream on the side.The setting, seats, tableware are all elegant and in good taste. This is definitely a place you could take out-of-town guests who want something fancy.The biggest surprise was that the place was practically empty - just a couple other tables were occupied in the main dining room.I can't understand it. Maybe folks just don't think of hotel restaurants when they're looking for a nice brunch or lunch option? Next time your usual brunch spot has a long line (or even if it doesn't), I'd encourage you to give 1808 Grille a look - 1808grille.com/pdf/Brunc…\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Since only a few tables were occupied, we found it odd that they seated us at a terrible table. The servers station of silverware, water, trays, etc. was right beside me. It was incredibly awkward. So we asked to move, which they were very nice about. Our waiter did fine, but wasn't very interested in being personable. We ended up having an assortment of small plates, chicken fried lobster, cold smoked scallops and chicken tortelloni. The lobster needed seasoning, the tortelloni was great and the smoked scallops were so good, we ordered another plate of them. Seriously, one of the best things I have ever eaten. But they just couldn't make up for the awkwardness of the silence and the lack of personality from the staff.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The brunch menu is well thought out with a good variety for your brunch taste-buds. The french toast is AMAZING especially because of the delicious not too sweet berry sauce that it comes with. My favorite thing about this place is that they have turkey sausage available for us non pork-eaters! This is almost unheard of in the south and a major reason I continue to dine here. I have also dined here for happy hour and was warmly greeted by the bartender, Dennis. Dennis is a great conversationalist for any person who decides they want to dine at the bar alone. The burger and fries here are awesome! Well seasoned on a toasty bun. It is my second pick in the city for burgers (after F. Scotts) and for a happy hour price of $5 for burger and fries it CAN'T be beat!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The wife and I ate here on a date night before heading to the Ryman for a show. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night. It was the only place near downtown with open reservations. I guess we found out why.We've eaten here a few times and it's always been hit or miss. Sometimes the service is off; sometimes it's the food. This time, it was a bit of both.Service: It was good. Our server was a little bit too chatty for my tastes, and would interrupt you while you were trying to place an order or request. Less talky; more servy there guy. He was capable, except when it came to opening our bottle of wine. He fumbled a bit, forgot to give me the cork until after he poured the sample and had trouble pronouncing the actual name. Also, he never came by to refill our glasses despite walking past us a few times. Minor quibble for sure, but it all rolls into the experience.Food: The food was very good, except for the dessert, which was putrid. I had the Wild Boar dumpling. It was hot and tasty, but the bean-sauce it was sitting in was cold-to-tepid. I'm not sure I would pair an Asian-style dumpling with a beans and sauerkraut, but it sort of worked. I also had the Braised Short Rib: always delicious and melt in your mouth. It saved the evening for me. The wife had the Bacon and Egg appetizer, which was very good. It doesn't hold a candle to a similar dish served at St. Johns, but pretty good nonetheless. She also had the \"Shrimp and Grits\". Basically, it was shrimp with heads sitting on a hominy cake with the saltiest pork confit I've ever tasted. She didn't complain, but the veins left in the shrimp even though the bodies were peeled, put her off I think. The hominy cake may have been delicious, but I can't see much to appreciate in this \"deconstruction\". If the original is so good, why \"deconstruct\" it?Wine: The only thing impressive about the wine list is the price. Most restaurants go 1.75 to 2.5 times what you would pay at a wine store. This place routinely goes 3.5 to 6 times what you would pay at a wine store. At one point, they were asking $120 for a bottle of MollyDooker The Boxer: a wine that costs $25-27 at most stores. I ended up paying $65 for a bottle that costs $18-20 anywhere on the planet.Dessert: I'm not usually a fan. I'd rather have a drink instead. The wife heard \"Chess Pie\" mentioned at a nearby table, and we thought we would try it. In the past, the desserts at 1808 were always delicious. I'm thinking of Banana Beignets here. But what we were served on this occasion looked like an elementary school Play-Do creation: and it tasted about the same. The crust had been so overworked and overcooked, it was absolutely rock hard. We both had to jam our forks into it to try to break it up. Even that barely worked. The dish was served ice cold (who serves pie cold?), with a scoop of tasteless \"vanilla\" gelato slathered on top. We had to unbury the filling from the gelato it was drowning in. It turns out the filling was not worth resuscitating. In this 4-inch high and 7-inch round terracotta dough bowl, was literally 1/2 inch of filling that was average at best. Now, the deserts are not that expensive ($7), but how do you end your service on that note? I think they had the dishwasher from the kitchen fill in for the dessert creations on this one. Chuck that one to the curb. It was horrifying.Bottom line: I don't know why I keep coming back here. I guess I really want to get a complete experience. But up to this point, it's never happened. I guess I've been spoiled by St. John's in Chattanooga. I'd rather spend a night in Chattanooga and have a stellar meal at the same price I paid for a so-so meal at the Hutton. If you decide to come here, stick to the red-meat entrees and steer clear of the other items, especially the wine and the desserts.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "My co-workers and I are experts on the 1808 menu. We ate three lunches there over the course of three days, plus I had one late-night snack (room service from the Hutton). Between all of us, we may have ordered everything on the menu.Day 1: Squash soup and panzanella salad. The soup was lovely and creamy. I thought the salad was OK, but not great. Panzanella is supposed to be a very bread-y salad, but this wasnt. It was mostly spinach with croutons. Day 2: Tomato soup and a burger. Soup was delicious. Burger was delicious and juicy as all get out. I did not enjoy the dressing (I asked for no dressing, but they still did it). I just scraped it off and it was excellent. The shoestring fries come in this cute little fryer-like basket with a handle. It made it easy to share!Day 3: Crab cake sandwich: This is served open-faced and honestly I didn't eat anything except the crab cake because I could only focus on how good it was. The focaccia remained untouched. We sat at a big square table in a private room every day, so we didn't get to see much of the actual restaurant. That room is a nice place for a work group or any kind of group because it is pretty isolated. Service was quite good. We had different servers, but they were all friendly.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "We ate here for Easter Sunday brunch (we booked within the week and couldn't get in other places - specifically MacK and Kate's). I was impressed initially with the comfort of the booths. And I was pleasantly surprised they make flavored lattes, and the vanilla nonfat latte was very good. I ordered the griddle (I think that's what it was called): potatoes and peppers covered with egg and some cheese. It was really that simple. It tasted fine but I was not impressed - I can make that better at home! I ordered the white cheddar cheese grits on the side and they were amazing. I highly recommend you order them. My server was great about ensuring I received a gluten free meal, and the kitchen was great about grilling my potatoes instead of flash frying them so they'd be gluten free. I was shocked that many of the other patrons were dressed so casually! It was Easter Sunday, for crying out loud. Many in t-shirts and jeans. I'm not sure if that's because 1808 Grille is inside a hotel (Hutton Hotel) and people just run down to eat before they check out. I'd eat here again, but I'm in no rush.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This place came highly rated by my local colleagues, but proved to be a disappointment. The food was not bad, but not remarkable in any way and certainly not worth the somewhat inflated prices. The appetizers were probably the best value: tasty and reasonable (I recommend the flatbread). The much-touted burger and short rib were mediocre. The firecracker apple torte and banana beignets did not live up to their promising titles. Overall, not bad for drinks and munchies, but better places to eat nearby.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We were being spontaneous and did not have a reservation, but they were able to seat us with in 10 minutes of arriving. While waiting, we just sat at the bar and had some fabulous cocktails. The menu was very diverse and they have a vegan offering!!! I could not be happier to go to a NICE restaurant that is thoughtful and inventive with their non-meat options. This is why they got 5 stars from me. This is why it is worth the money to eat here. The current vegan offering is chile relleno. It was fabulous- the flavor was good, there was so definite heat, and the portion was decent (unlike some other upscale restaurants).Additionally, they recommended wine pairings for your meal. I took total advantage of this and loved it. Overall, it's a great upscale dining experience. Perfect for special occasions.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The decor was mod in the hotel and restaurant, but the seating is not condusive to a date night. It is more like hotel breakfast buffet seating. I also get irked when hostesses seat everyone right on top of each other while there is so much empty space in a restaurant. Clearly we were on a date and they sit us next to a family of four in tshirts and flip flops. I know you get a mixed bag at a hotel, but on to the food.My $16 pinot noir was fabulous, but the waiter offered no direction when I told him I was leaning towards a red. We ordered the sister schubert grilled cheese app which sounded great. When we got it, it was a flattened panini with hardly any filling. BIG disappointment. My husband ordered the cannaloni and I got the short ribs. His dish was more like a lean cuisine with huge cloves of garlic inside and out. My short ribs were tender, but blah. My mom's pot roast is better, and I don't even like her pot roast. The waiter forgot our mushroom side, but brought it anyway and I thought I was going to vomit they were so terrible. Reminded me of fatty meat or something. Maybe I am not used to oyster mushrooms, but I typically like ALL mushrooms. No flavor on this side. I hate to give a bad review, but I feel the good reviews on this place were paid or some incentive was given to write such outstanding reviews. I will not be going back, nor will I recommend this place. Very disappointed. :(\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Honestly, 1808 Grille is in my top 3 favorite restaurants for Nashville. They are consistently considerate, knowledgeable, and passionate about their food and wine. We make sure to call for a late reservation, and then show up early to sit at the bar. We received a couple of different \"snacks\" with our drinks, which is a good way to keep you from getting intoxicated to early in the evening. I have not one negative thing to say about the place (extremely rare). We've gone for a casual night out, anniversary, and even on New Years Eve with each time being special in its own way. Bravo 1808! I love that they bring you some anti-pasta upon sitting down, without you even ordering it. Their stuffed blue cheese martinis taste like water, so beware. If you want to have a fabulous dinner in a warm  inviting atmosphere with comfortable booths for seating then this is the place!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Jeff spent a lot of time with us recommending some favorites. We are visiting Nashville for the week and will certainly be back. Located in the Hutton Hotel, this is a do not miss place for a great dinning experience at a reasonable price. Highly recommended!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

However  after ordering cheese plate and a bottle of wine it ended there. He spent the entire dinner socializing with the table right next to ours. We heard all,about his music and sport interests for a looooong time. Someone else brought our entrees out... They were cold. We poured our own wine. He NEVER asked if we needed anything. When we pushed our plates to the side of our table which  he was standing with his hand on our chair he finally acknowledged us. He said \"y'all aren't staying in the hotel are you?\". We are. And when we let him know our name happens to be Hutton he appeared a little nervous! Very disappointed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It's all the best parts of Nashville's friendliness and obsession with farm fresh food in a very groovy setting.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The server came by to let me know they ran out but would substitute it with another meaty white fish-I appreciated the head's up. The bf got his steak perfectly medium rare.

    "comments": "I generally have great luck finding great food and service in each new city that we visit. Today my luck came to an end. I was unaware that this was located in a hotel, which should have been a warning sign. The second warning should have been the lack of diners on a Friday evening at 7:00pm. The hostess and food runners were great. While our waitress was LOST! We were rushed to order a drink, only to have her disappear for 10 minutes before they arrived. After a few minute lapse she returned to take our food order. My wife asked about the seafood special and mid sentence she paused to read her wrinkled up cheat sheet. My wife chose the scallops, while I picked the short rib. There was never any mention of our side options, as they are chefs choice. The least our waitress could done was present them while ordering. Had she done so, I would have walked out the door. Our food arrived rather quickly and looked wonderful, until the sides hit the table. I have this hate hate relationship with rosemary, not the girl from Shallow Hal, but the horrific tasting herb. Two of the 3 sides contained this monstrosity of flavor. While our entrees were ok, they were not great. The horseradish cream was overwhelming the flavor of the beef. The pea purée base for the scallops had the flavor of sea water. As I finished my beef, I decided to try the sprout salad and was once again disappointed. The last of the utter disappointment arrived with the check. I had just wasted $80 on a meal that left me hungry and searching on yelp for why. Why does this place show 4 stars? Why did I not trust my empty gut feeling when I arrived? Why were there only 2 more patrons dining in the hour since we arrived?So if you skipped to the end of this review to get the cliff notes. Go across the street to the service station and buy you a big gulp and some funyons. You will be much happier in the end.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I have been here for annual events so I was familiar with the property. We got a chance to really see all the perks of the hotel. The amenites are great and so thoughtful. pre-bagged ice. special coffee/cappiano makers on every floor, complimentary wine hour so free drinks daily from 5-6 for guests only). So, the resturant, as you can see from the pics is beautiful. Nothing is out of place. Very comfortable yet grand with very high ceilings and lots of windows. Lunch menu is good pricing, all under 15 for the most part. 15 being thier upscale version of a meat and 3. That's what I had. The steak was amazing! The flavor was so robust! mac and cheese and potatos! It is worth sneaking out of the office for every once in a while if you can make it!We were with the Director so the service was great of course.

    "comments": "Yep. 1808 gets points from the beginning for setting my group in their private dining room. The room's set up in a big square adorned with rock, wood and plants, so I felt like I was a member of the UN solving problems or something. Or, the Cabinet*. Or, the Justice League**. I liked it.Now, it could be because we were in the Hall of Justice, but I was very impressed by the service. The staff operated as a team and made sure that we were always taken care of. We ate here three days in a row and that kind of repetition could become monotonous for both the diner and the staff. The staff took care to make sure each day was like the first day. Again, appreciated... and noted. Of the lunch options, my favorite was the open-face crab cake sandwich and skinny herb fries. I wanted to order it for every lunch. I did. I thought, though, the better part of valor was to try something new every day. I was mistaken -- not because anything I tried was bad or unsavory but because the crab cake is *that* good. Get it and be happy with your choice. One thing I did manage to have all three days was a bottle of the lemonade. There was some inside joke that it was a slight pain to give it to me every day... but I ignored it. I like what I like. Keep me happy and there'll be no 'Bless her heart'ings.

    "comments": "After attending a lovely Yelp event earlier this week I decided to take my  monthly girl's breakfast/brunch group to 1808 Grille for our March outing. I had never been here for a meal, so I was going off of Yelp reviews to make my decision.I made reservations the day before using the restaurants online booking tool, but once I arrived this morning I realized I probably didn't need to do that. At 9am on a Saturday, they weren't exactly busting at the seams with business. I don't mind that though! It was quiet and gave my girlfriends and I a relaxed atmosphere to catch up in.Our waiter, Micheal, quickly got our drink orders and kept our coffee mugs full and hot the entire time. He was very observant of all of our needs and I felt that he did a fantastic job attending to them all. I ordered the Cinnamon Challah Bread French Toast with a Mixed Berry Sauce and a side of fried eggs over hard. My eggs were perfect-o.  I liked the variation on the french toast from a traditional bread and the mixed berry sauce was good enough to not use any syrup (although I did). The food was delicious and worth the cost of the meal. One of my girlfriends had the Breakfast Burrito with choirzo sausage, queso blano, scallions and fresh salsa. She said it was amazing!I will say the only complaint was that some things in the restaurant and hotel lobby (like the restrooms) were a little more form than function. While everything looks nice and chic, it's not always the best idea. One of my friends (who may be the tallest girl I know) noted that the toilets in the women's room were \"about an inch and a half off the ground\" and the sinks \"stressed her out\" a bit. I know those are picky things and that won't keep me from going back to 1808 Grille for another meal in the future.Great service and great food here and I would recommend their breakfast for sure!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Overall, it was a great brunch. The only thing I would say it could improve upon would be the atmosphere - it's a good restaurant, but it still has the feel of a hotel lobby (it is attached to the hotel). But for the quality of the food, it's still worth it to go and just bring your own atmosphere. :)\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

But once in awhile, you need to splurge. That's how I landed at the 1808 Grille at the Hutton Hotel, where from 4-6 PM each weekday,  people get more than they expect (deserve?). All of the food is half priced, meaning that the $10 burger, covered in delicious sharp white cheddar, a shaved lettuce slaw, tomato and thousand island dressing (with a side of garlic parsley fries included) is five bucks.FIVE BUCKS! And it was literally one of the most phenomenal burgers ever. Toss in a glass of pinot noir for like $6 or 2 for 1 domestic light beers and you've one happy hour. Or two.We came here last week and the food and drink were phenomenal. The only problem was my food took forever to come out (almost an hour), so they comped my food. That just continued my impression of pure service that the Hutton Hotel gave me (when I stayed there a year ago).I will continue to recommend 1808 and their happy hour for a long time!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I'm so happy we decided to have dinner here because it really was worth every penny. To start off with, I had the split pea soup and my boyfriend ordered the Gazpacho. Both starters were delicious. For the main course, I had the Four Day Marinated Skirt Steak with the corn and asparagus succotash. My boyfriend had the Arctic Char plate with potato salad in a mustard vinaigrette. Both plates were cooked just right. Not too salty, not too oily, just right. We were extremely satisfied with our choices. For dessert, we split the 1808 Blast and it was devoured in seconds. They bring these delicious soft baked, still warm chocolate chip cookies to go with it. Heaven!  Even after we were done, the waiter brought us samples on a spoon of this Strawberry Custard, compliments of the chef. Equally as tasty!After we finished dinner, we decided to have drinks at the bar. Amazingly, they were cheaper than they were at the clubs we went to last night. And they were made just right which always makes a difference. The 1808 Grille is a delicious choice for a nice dinner out.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I didn't eat here yet, but I'd like someone to take me on a fancy date here. I did have a few drinks with my girlfriends on Valentine's Day, though.We were extremely excited to see our old favorite bartender Chess, who used to be at Past Perfect, is part of this new staff. The place looks great, and super swanky. It's got a nice row of bar seating, then two separate dining areas and a lounging area as well. We had a great time sitting on the couches and sipping on a few drinks. Definitely a good place for a few drinks after work, but I wouldn't feel comfortable in jeans and a tee.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Hutton and we decided to try the 1808 for a light dinner    At least that was the initial plan.The menu looked amazing so we decided to just try some small plates.  We started with corn gazpacho and cream of she crab soup.  Both were amazing.  The corn gazpacho with light and fresh, the crab soup rich and decadent. We then has the goat Brie with port wine chutney.   It came with a fresh whole wheat baggett.  A very tasty bite to start our meal. We then had a shrimp and scallop sausage Patty.  The only miss of the evening.   My wife said the main flavor was salt and wouldn't have even guessed the primary ingrediants.  Next came spatzle with braised duck.  If they had brought a dinner portion instead of a small plate, I could have died happy then and there.  Instead they followed up with a pork meatball in a Ginger sauce that my wife actually claimed was even better than the duck.  By then she'd had two of their port of call cocktails, so I forgive her blasphemy.  From there it was on to dessert, I had a rich decadent chocolate mousse bombs my wife had their cake pops chocolate,Ginger and red velvet.  The waiter informed us they hired a new pastry chef. My advice, give him/her a big raise and expand the selections because I could have been tempted for more than one dessert. WOW!!!  Along with attentive, friendly and professional service, beautiful decor helped make it a very memorable dinner.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So embarrassed that I recommended meeting for dinner at 1808 during my brother and sister-in-law's very brief stay in Nashville.    I honestly wish we could re-do the night.  Food, for the most part, was medicore or below.  Mine was downright bad.  I ordered the \"crispy trout\" - which the waiter recommended.  It was mushy (@ 1/4 inch thick) and nearly tastless- except for the odd pairing of a chili-asian sauce that did not work well with it.  The food was lukewarm upon being served.  My sister-in-law got the scallops, which she claimed were good (though also just lukewarm), and the beet salad (which she was really looking forward to), which she said was \"different\".  My  husband said his was \"ok\", and my brother-in-law made no comments (which I didn't take as a good sign).  The waiter never asked how our food was- simply stopped by asking, \"are you doing ok?\".  The dessert menu was disappointing - brother in law got sorbet (nothing else sounded interesting) and I simply opted for a cappuccino.  Adding to my embarrasment was an obnoxiously drunk woman yelling from the bar area.  She was so loud (and so obviously drunk) that we coudn't hear our conversation.  A number of people were looking at her (as she continued), including hotel staff members- I was waiting for someone to ask her to leave...but they didn't.  I felt as if we were in a honkey-tonk on Broadway (could even hear the bartendar yelling back to someone in order to be heard over the woman).  And to top things off, I received an email the following day from Opentable (through which I booked the reservation), stating that the restaurant claimed I \"didn't honor my reservation\" (and asked me to please cancel in the future or my account may be deactivated).  ?!  Wow.  I assured Opentable that I would not rely on their recommendations again- and that they could go ahead and deactivate my account.  Looked for somewhere/someone to contact at the 1808 site, but couldn't find anything, so decided to post here.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The menu online looked great, and the fact that it was in the Hutton Hotel was a selling point for us since we stayed there on our wedding night in June. But oops, we made a terrible choice.Our entrées were bad, bad, bad. My husband ordered the New York strip and it was tough and fatty. He kept having to spit pieces out. He said, \"I could have made a better one at home... and I have made a better one at home.\" As for my grouper, which was the seafood of the day, the first 2 bites were great. But then I got toward the middle and cut into something tough and rubbery. Upon further inspection, the fish was completely raw in the middle. EW. I had already spooned my sides onto the plate (delicious mushrooms and really good Parmesan mashed potatoes), and I let our server know it was undercooked. She took the whole plate and said she would take care of it. I sat and waited for it, and it was returned to me on a shiny new plate... with no sides. By that point, not only had the undercooked fish grossed me out so much that I could barely take another bite of it, but the small amounts of sides that remained in the little dishes had gotten cold. Quite disappointing, and we both left hungry and irritated.To be fair - the service was great and the ambiance was very nice. Our server was really sweet and helpful. She made sure the grouper was removed from our bill and profusely apologized. I appreciated it when she told me it really would have upset her too to get undercooked fish. The manager came over and spoke with us, apologized and gave us a buy one entrée get one free coupon... that expired exactly one week later. Hmmm. Sadly, I'm pretty sure we will not be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

There are L-shaped couches for seats at some of the tables. We were seated promptly, where the table had a variety of olives and flat crispy bread. While I'm not a fan of olives, it was unique. The food was quite good- I tried their old world flat bread, which was flavorful and crispy. The stuffed dates were so unique- a combo of sweet date and savory cheese, all wrapped in bacon, was really rich. I couldn't eat more than one. My entree was the original short ribs, perfectly cooked, tender, flavorful and the sour cream and onion crisps complemented perfectly. Could have used some veggies though. Had the banana beignets for desert, which were okay- the sauce they served it with was rather bland. 4 stars because the service was spotty- didn't have our waiter there when we needed him and the servers seems hectic, even though the restaurant wasn't busy.

I hope they make it!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Four of us went for Lunch on Monday. Started with the Charred Tomato soup, which was tasty, but the coriander sour cream was lost on us/  Also tried the Tuscan bean soup, and expected there to be beans floating in a bean soup, but it was more bean broth with a pasty glob of mushrooms and barley floating in the middle of the soup.  The bean broth was nice, but not the soup we expected.  Ordered the Almost Classic Cobb.  It was nothing like any Cobb salad I had ever had, and not in a good way.  The Pancetta crisp was so thin and tasteless.  The roasted chicken was, I think, still in the kitchen because it wasn't on the salad.  There were plenty of olives, and a smathering of cucumber and not enough white cheddar cheese to be counted as an actual ingredient.  There were 2 hard boiled egg halves, but the kind of hard boiled eggs that arrive in 5 gallon buckets in a brine solution.  The cherry tomatoes we cold, so they had absolutely no taste, and the creamy oregano dressing was totally unremarkable.Somebody had the Sirloin burger and was totally happy with it.  There was a beautiful think slice of tomato on the burger, but since it had been refrigerated, it was mushy and tasteless.....(don't restaurants know not to refrigerate tomatoes?)  The shave lettuce slaw was wet and unexciting.Another ordered the Open face crab cake sandwich.  It was tasty, but the Old Bay Slaw tasted like wet Savoy cabbage with precious little dressing of any kind for flavor.Lastly,  the 4th party was very happy with her Citrus pork Panini with Manchego cheese and BBQ glaze.The presentation was great on everything.  The Garlic fries came in little mini fry baskets ( these look like they came from Dollar Tree) and were hot when they cam to the table, but cooled rather quickly.  They were also a little too greasy and garlicky for our taste.Dessert was the Banana Beignet.   They were a great hit in their oun little bag fresh out of the fryer with the creme anglaise, with a hint of hazel nut (more like a secret).Also for Dessert was the Peanut butter Mousse.  There was a plate with \"stuff\" on it but nobody was quite sure what was supposed to happen with the \"stuff\".  It required some assembly.All in all, nothing was horrible, but then nothing was outstanding either.  There was nothing that made me want to get a bunch of friends together and have lunch there before everybody else did.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

No one is turned away and everybody eats to the point of exhaustion.  Sometimes stereotypes can be a good thing, like Mangia. If you know what Mangia means in Italian and you grew up with tons of Italian friends like I did than you have visions of pasta fairies and garlic bread sprites dancing in your head.  Unlike most restaurants with catchy names, Mangia is serious. Dont be fooled by what starts as small appetizers. We went too a Saturday night five course meal with friends, and I mean some of the guys in our group make me look tiny by comparison, and all of us could barely push ourselves away from the table.  On top of that, they got all of us to dance and sing in between courses! Seriously, I have not danced in public since the Mavericks won the NBA championship!This place is surprising for a several reasons:1. The quality of italian food is homemade, nuanced, and refined.2. The pace of service and quality is spot on for a \"family\" meal.3. Bring your own wine. Pace yourself, this makes for great people watching. 4. Its off the beaten path in Melrose on Craighead street.If you dont try Mangia you should get slapped upside yourhead like John Travolta in Staying Alive!PS the bread at the table is incredible!

On Friday and Saturday you do have to make a reservation so be sure to call ahead and also confirm you are coming. It's $50 per person and that doesn't include drinks, tax, or gratuity. We were a party of two so we were sat with a another party of two. There were a lot of larger groups but it doesn't matter how many people you have because it's family style and you'll be seated with other people plus your party anyways. We started with cocktails and martinis. I had the Valentini which was pomegranate juice, vodka, and limoncello. My bf had the aperol spritz which was aperol, prosecco, club soda, and orange twist. Both of our drinks where nice and simple yet tasty. Definitely not a craft cocktail but what you would expect of a solid drink. Later with our meal we enjoyed the house red wine which was nicely priced at $6 and very delicious with our pasta dishes. And after dinner we had the Tom Hagan and the Mangia-tini which were both very refreshing and light.The food changes regularly but the dishes we had were super tasty and filling. You have to take it easy on each dish and remember that more is on the way! It was great to meet new people and hate a meal with them. Through out the meal everyone Dances and sings which helps you to digest and not get that give me a nap feeling! This is an awesome concept and you can feel the love in what they are doing here. Mangia was definitely one of my more enjoyable date night meals.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

For $50.00 on the weekends you get a full 6 course experience complete with dancing (and its mandatory). They offer affordable wine and we settled into a lengthy dinner experience. Highlights: The focaccia with olive oil was the first item I tried and one of my favorites. It was perfect! I also loved the scallops, rigatoni with butternut squash, sage, and brown butter. I couldn't stop eating it! The herb crusted pork loin was a home run as well, and the cappuccinos with our donuts didn't disappoint either. I wasn't such a fan of the short rib pasta or the risotto cakes (very bland), but the good thing about this experience is it's family style, and you get to try a bit of everything and if you aren't a fan of one item, another heaping dish is right behind it for you try! The staff was absolutely incredible and fun, and you can tell that this isn't just a restaurant, it's a passion for them! I appreciated all the work they put into making our meal an experience.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

No tiramisu either. Gluten free options for most choices, but very bread-focused. Sorry to my low-carb friends.I got the chicken parm (no bread) and the waitress offered to put it on a salad. I asked for arugula, no dressing or other toppings, but the waitress said the salads were pre-made. Strange, my appetizer (grilled cheese) arrived on a bed of arugula.

    "comments": "I heard about Mangia Nashville from a work friend, and I knew it wasn't just an Italian meal, but an experience...  so on a whim, I e-mailed to see if they had an opening on the weekend after our wedding.  Reservations are required! They did, and we decided to make it a celebration of our first week of wedded bliss!We attended near the end of their summer menu, and they make seasonal updates throughout the year.  We arrived on time, and we were seated family style at one of a few large tables set up at Cool Cafe, their current location.  (Word on the street is that they're moving at some point, so keep up on their Facebook page!)  We were seated with other guests, which was very fun... we even ended up sharing bottles of wine with our tablemates.I loved the antipasti!  While I don't like olives (and made Dan eat some of my fried olives), I LOVE risotto and mozzarella.  The housemade focaccia was delicious too.  Everything is served family style, so you pass dishes around and take your portion. I may have to try to make risotto cakes at home.The seasonal salad was really interesting, since it combined fruits and tomatoes.  Definitely a summer dish!  I'm not a salad person, so this was a nice alternative for me.My favorite dishes were definitely the pastas!  Seriously, I can't even describe.  I want to eat them all the time.  The bolognese was delicious and the orrechiette was awesome.  By the time we got to the entrata, I'd had a lot of wine and didn't even remember to take photos.  But I remember the chicken was moist and delicious, and Dan loved the roasted veggies.Oh, and the other thing I forgot to mention... there's dancing.  There's singing.  I remember belting out \"Summer Nights\" from Grease at one point.  And a women's conga line.  Nights at Mangia Nashville feel like attending a wedding reception with a bunch of strangers, but everyone ends up leaving as friends.  It's an event, in every sense of the word!  The creator of Mangia, Nick, has made Friday and Saturday nights a true celebration.The desserts were top notch.  The panna cotta was incredible, and I ate it all.  Everyone took delicious zeppole home, one of my favorite parts of the night.  NO ONE is making ricotta doughnuts this good in Nashville, and Nick did it first!We paid about $170 for two, including a bottle of chianti and tax.  When you think of all the courses (not all pictured here, because, well, wine) that is honestly one of the best deals in town.  I recommend it for larger groups of friends and family who aren't shy, couples who want a celebratory date for a birthday or anniversary, or just for a splurge.  There were event people who came by themselves, befriending others along the way.This experience definitely had Dan's seal of approval; in fact, he remarked that he'd love to bring his (Italian) best friend there, which is very indicative of what he thought of the meal!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I was just sure he would find that he was wrong and have a great time. Its fun to prove him wrong sometimes. In the past I've found that Yelp is usually on point with restaurant ratings so I, on the other hand, was super excited for a night out at Mangia with friends. Another reviewer described it as olive garden meets an adult Chuck E. Cheese. Surely that wasn't going to be accurate.  But it kind of was. The food was just okay at best. Mass preparation of that much food I'm sure is a challenge, but the food was lukewarm and honestly nothing better than what I can make at home (and I'm no great cook). I know a big part of Mangia is the experience- the dancing, the conga line, etc- but at the end of the night it was just terribly loud & cliche, too much stimulation, and overly expensive for at best, average food. Oh, and prepare yourself that you will have to yell at each other and have the server yell at you in order to be heard. If you want to drop this much on a meal do yourself a favor and go to the Catbird Seat or one of the many other amazing restaurants in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The same thoughtfulness and fresh ingredients go into their lunch menu as everything else Nick and his team do. The panini was nothing short of amazing -- and everything was reasonably priced. I was excited to get fresh zeppole (italian donuts -- think...beignet!) for dessert -- a bargain at 2 for $3.00! The perfect end to a great lunch.  I LOVE their iced tea -- infused with fresh basil -- yum!  Will definitely be back.\n        Was this review …?\n    \n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This is my third trip to Mangia's.  My other two weekday trips were good enough to warrant a third trip.   The first time we ordered the Verdura Focaccia with Mangia Chicken.  It was good enough, although a bit a skimpy on the cheese and some of the toppings.  The second time I visited I ordered extra cheese.  This last visit was extraordinarily magnificent!    Everything was perfect.   I don't usually like flavored Iced Tea, but their unsweetened basil tea is light and refreshing.  It doesn't even  need sugar!    They have salads, padinos (sandwiches), and focaccia pizza.  My husband is a simple pizza type of guy, although this is a bit more fancy.  He was still able to order a pepperoni, sausage, pancetta, mushroom, roasted bell pepper pizza with red sauce.  It wasn't too far out for him and he loved it!  The Garlic Focaccia is lightly seasoned and very yummy.  I like the Black Carbon Focaccia best.  It doesn't taste like charcoal and has supposed health benefits.   I usually order the Verdura, which is Pesto, Mozzarella, I added Ricotta Salata, Artichoke Hearts, Cremini Mushrooms, Roasted Grape Tomatoes, Balsamic Onions, and Mangia seasoned roasted Chicken Breast.    My husband also tried the Porchetta, which he very much enjoyed.   Mangia's is not your boring, plain ol' chain pizza establishment.  It's over the top delicious with friendly and great service.   Sarah was our server.  She was fun and was able to keep up with my husband's jokes.We want to make reservations for one of their weekend special 7-Course Italian Feasts.  Only 6:30 is a little late for us, but most likely perfect for most.We did not find the menu limited.  With a bit of creativity the possibilities are endless.  They have many cheeses, three sauces to choose,different meats and toppings.  You could very well invent a different Focaccia Pizza each visit.We're happy to have a clean, yummy, and new place to lunch and dine out closer to home.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The entertainment and dancing was so much fun -and prevented that \"stuffed\" feeling.   We will definitely return next time we're in Nashville.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

The appitizers were ok but served room tempature, fried olives and fried rosotto cakes. The salad was overly bitter. One of the men in my group commented \"uggh, its so bitter...how do you fuck up a salad\" next the pastas came out, the first was in a brown butter sauce but they put squash and nuts on it, combo didn't really work for me but noodles were good. Second pasta was shells with red sauce, again noodles were good but meat in the sauce was stringy  rib meat and honestly the sauce was very bland, tasted unsalted and I could descern no garlic. After hours more of music and bull shit where they try to force hungry strangers to dance with eachother they brought out the chicken that was so dry and chewy that it was difficult to swallow without water, but I did because it was nearly 1030  and I was ready to eat at 7......come on already. Next the pork loin that was rather good, but again luke warm stuffed with spinach. Chocolate pudding and doughnuts for dessert that were unimaginative, but executed well.     Outside of the lackluster, cold, and dissapointing food, the tempature in this place was all outta wack hot then cold, up and down all night. So loud that the only people in my group I could talk to was right next to me or right across from me. Only 2 bathroom stalls for a restrauant full of people, and my water glass was empty constantly because the waitress was less that attentitive. Be prepared that if you go, don't expect to eat for 3 hours. I left hungry not because there was not enough food, but because it was not fit to eat. I'll not be back and recommend you don't either. Most of the people in my party felt the same about the food but had fun dancing around drunk. This place is a must miss, there are waaaay better options for good italian around town.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

While the food and the experience is well worth the $50/head (+tax and gratuity), I was told that my total number in my party was less than I had asked to confirm and I would have to also pay for my no-shows. To be fair, I was told in advance that I would confirm the final numbers at least 48 hours in advance. I'm sure it happens all the time that larger parties don't attend with all confirmations, but I was surprised to pay the full price-without take out boxes, for those that unfortunately could not make the party. I respect the reservation process and this isn't your normal come and go restaurant, it's definitely an experience. While we had a good time and enjoyed the food (two of the courses were particularly good), I left feeling taken advantage of, instead of finding a compromise after bringing more than 20 new patrons into the Mangia experience. While I'll return at some point in the future, I'll be far more careful to attend in a small group setting so as not to be left holding the bill for no shows. More a heads up to future large groups.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Count on 3 plus hours of eating (go hungry - there is A LOT of food served) singing and dancing (if you want, not mandatory) and good old fashioned fun, Italian style. It is a set menu, but there is SO much food served family style that you will have no trouble getting happily full.Nick is a great ambassador not only for his creation of Mangia, but for the Italian tradition of sharing food and time together with the ones we love and with some new folks too.

So first of all, this place is in the most obscure location. I mean I don't really know Nashville all too well but it did not look to be in a  \"friendly\" or \"welcoming\" part of town. But with grumbling stomachs, we decided to give it a go. Both of us walked into the very empty restaurant craving a big plate of pasta. To our displeasure, no such \"pasta\" existed on the menu. So we decided to get the pizza's which, in all honesty, weren't all that good. Also, to add to the discomfort, the restaurant was extremely cold the entire time. Over all, I would not recommend this little place. #sorrynotsorry\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

From the moment the waitress begins telling you about your meal you know this is not just a meal but more like a theatrical meal. They had the Godfather movie playing on their tv's and music that they had you clapping to or dancing to depending on where they were in the meal. I was really impressed that the chef made sure to have other options available for some at the party that could not eat beef or pork or the few that were vegetarians. The chicken that was served was juicy and flavorful. Pasta dish was really good. Honestly the entire meal to me was great. Be prepared to sit there for 3 hours though because it is a dining experience not just a meal at a restaurant. A really fun experience that I hope to have the pleasure to go to again soon.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Olive Garden meets Monell's meets an adult version of Chuck E. Cheese.My wife & I went with a large group; which is about the only reason I ever go to Williamson County for food.  We had heard of this place and knew that it was \"family style\" and out of curiosity committed to go. First of all, Mangia Nashville is not date night worthy. It is loud and you'll lose your voice from yelling across the table, especially since dinner is 3+ hours. On the positive, the service was very responsive and courteous. The amount of food is volumnous, so if you're used to Golden Corral or Cheddar's value you'll get it with your $45. I'll step through our meal a course at a time.4 (yes 4) appetizers - I didn't realize Italians fried this much of their food. First was fried green olives...pretty basic. Next was mushrooms and onions in a sweet beef broth - which would've been great had I got to experience mushrooms. By the time the bowl got to me, there were just onions. Third was a pan-fried risotto cake with some sort of lemon/rosemary dipping sauce - pretty good stuff. Fourth was a mozzarella cheese sandwich about 2\" square...that was fried. And it was served with marinara sauce that could've easily come straight from a jar.Salad - a Caesar salad that I believe came from a kit; however the croutons which were greasy are definitely homemade.2 pastas - this first pasta probably would've been the best course had it a little more salt or just more porcini, and maybe some garlic. The sauce had a nice consistency and good base flavor and the penne pasta was cooked perfectly. The second pasta I lucked out because the plate came to me first - a shell pasta in bolognese sauce with short ribs. I had a nice portion of short ribs in my serving but I'm not sure anyone else got any (I know my wife who went second didn't). Again, another red sauce served that was as bland as what's served in assisted living facility.BREAK FROM EATING!!!! Now is when the staff gets everyone up for about 15 minutes of conga lines, sing alongs, and choreographed numbers to work off and make space for the rest of the meal that's coming your way. Being in a large group made this part of the evening tolerable but I sort of get why it's there. During the singing of \"Baby I need your lovin'\" as I was on the guy side of the sing-along, I happened to be behind Chef Nick when he yelled in the customer's ear next to him \"Women love this sh!t\". Ahh...there ya go.Now back to the food.2 entrees - first up Rosemary chicken with broccolini and this was an excellent dish. This as a stand-alone would be a $20 entree and it would stand up to the price. Seasoned perfectly, tender moist chicken with a slight crisp to the skin. It was great! Second entree that I believe was intended to be the apex of the meal fell short though - veal osso bucco style. They actually nailed osso bucco but unfortunately there was so much fat my pallet sort of got lost - as at this point my voice.2 desserts - first up cookie size cannolis. They were good, but I'm highly confident they were store bought; certainly the shells were. And as a parting gift with your tab a take home bag with a couple of \"italian donuts\"  in it- which were more like sweet hush puppies. Not sure what the attachment to frying things is but to me this was a detractor and not what you want the parting gift you want to leave with your customers...I would've preferred an Andes mint.I can't possible think of reason to go do this again unless forced to by the sheer inertia of peer pressure.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Read this before you go............if you don't you may 'miss it'! Miss what? If you go to Mangia just for good food you will miss the very essence of what it's all about. If you are Italian you will get this - Mangia is basically a New York paisane who hosts his daughter's wedding every Friday & Saturday nite. Heck he even does the seating assignments. You are not a customer. You are family, there to enjoy a celebration of food and life. Driving home I thought to myself that paying the check was like giving 'abusta' (envelope) after the wedding.Nick Pellegrino's passion for food and people is genuine & contagious.  He is not a NY reject who brought his lousy food to the south but instead captures the importance of breaking bread with family & friends within the Italian culture. It's what we live for. It's a passion that runs deep into the soul and is impossible to contain. This is the Mangia Miracle as Nick affectionately calls it. You sit with strangers and leave as family. So is the food good? This is where you see the passion ooze. It's not fine dining; nor is it designed to be but all five senses will instinctively react in harmony telling you it's quality brought together with heart. No other restaurant could get away with serving zeppoles in a paper bag w/ powder sugar but I was about undone when they hit the table. If you are not Italian and none of this makes sense - Go!  Go experience the heart and soul of Italian culture and eat the best food in Nashville.  If you are visiting from NY/NJ you will forget you're below the Mason Dixon line.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I have dined with Nick at least 4 or 5 times now and am getting to be a pro. Quick tips, eat small portions, I had 1 olive and split the fried cheese with my wife. Take a spoonful or spoon and 1/2 of pasta, otherwise you can go off and eat like 3 or 4 normal size meals in 1 sitting. I have to respond to the previous reviewer Stephen B. if you need more food, ask you waitress, we ran out of croutons for the salad and she eagerly brought us a bowl of them (btw they were delicious and almost air dried and not the least bit greasy.

    "comments": "We had a marvelous time this past Saturday night at Mangia!  It was our first time attending a true Mangia feast, though we'd experienced a private Mangia event at my workplace a few months back.  The in-house experience couldn't be beat - we had a great time and left completely stuffed and smiling hugely after a truly memorable meal.I'd heard that in order to make a reservation at Mangia you need to call months in advance.  This was NOT true in our case.  We took a chance and emailed the restaurant that day to see if any seats were open.  The restaurant emailed back almost immediately telling us they could easily accommodate our party of two.  I'm sure that for larger parties an advance reservation would be helpful - but if you're a small party and are willing to sit anywhere they can put you, I'd recommend taking your chances.  It worked for us!When we arrive at Mangia, we were seated immediately by the head chef himself.  He greeted us warmly and was genuinely excited to see us.  We were seated at a 6-top table with one other friendly couple.  We quickly engaged in conversation and enjoyed our appetizers together.  The appetizers were one of my favorite parts of the night, especially the parmesan cups filled with spaghetti squash, sun dried tomatoes and black olives.  Yum.  The tiny, perfectly-warmed sandwiches of serrano ham, cheese, arugula and pear were incredibly delicious as well.  The bread is also quite good, but do heed your servers warning about not eating too much of it - there's tons of food awaiting you!A huge plate of salad arrived next.  I wasn't planning on eating much of it, but the combination of fresh spinach, roasted onions, roasted grapes (which, by the way, are SO delicious - who'd have thought of roasting a grape???) and parmesan cheese won me over.  It was just so good and I ate more than my fair share.  Up next were the pasta dishes - one an oil and butter sauce with butternut squash and sage, the other a short-rib bolognese.  Both were great, though the butternut squash pasta was the clear winner of the two.  The meat entrees that followed were both tasty, but neither was a star of the meal.  The lemon-rosemary chicken was tender and juicy, and the pork dish was a bit too fatty for our liking (though the seasoning was fabulous).  Dessert arrived last, and the warm chocolate polenta with chocolate almond bark was the perfect ending to our night.  We ended up taking our pumpkin zeppoli home and enjoying them with decaf coffee as a midnight snack.  Yum.The staff was fantastic (shout out to our fabulous waitress, Rachel), the mid-meal dance party was a blast, and the positive energy and jovial mood of the people were infectious.  I was so surprised that Rachel and the head chef both remembered me from the event Mangia catered for my workplace - you can tell that the people who make the place what it is truly care about their business and clientele.  That, paired with the delicious food and fun atmosphere, is the true secret to Mangia's success.  We also couldn't believe that they allowed us to take our leftovers home - we left with enough pasta and chicken to eat for a few days - such a nice and useful surprise!  We thought the $50 price tag was more than fair for the landslide of food and fun experience we had.  We're already talking about when we can come back and who we can bring with us.  We can't wait to experience Mangia again and again!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I've never wanted yelp to have a rating higher than five stars in my 105 previous reviews, but after last night - I wish there was a way.If you have never been, you need to go call NOW to make your reservation, because it will be months before you can get in, and you're just going to be that much further behind if you wait until you read this.  Go on, I'm serious.  Call NOW.  I'll wait.OK, now that you're back. I don't think I have ever enjoyed a dinner more, I don't think I've ever eaten as much in one \"meal\" before, never been at a table for so long, and I have never consumed an entire bottle of wine by myself, either.  The Mangia event lasted four hours last night, and just kept getting more and more fun.To the yelpers that said they thought you had to have a large group - no, you don't.  If you are a party of two or possibly even four, you will be seated with other nice people to enjoy the family style feast, and we left with two new friends in Franklin trading business cards and stories.  Most of the other yelp reviews talk about a $5 corkage fee, that is now $15 just so noone is unpleasantly surprised, because you don't want anything to spoil your night with Chef Nick and family.  OK, boring updates/corrections done.Everything we ate from the five extended courses was really good - some things I absolutely, positively loved.  Parmesean cups with squash, olives, and sundried tomatoes - as delicious as you are thinking.  And a chef that thinks to stuff green olives with fresh mozzarella and then fry it, mozarella that he made just an hour before the 6 PM Mangia start time - fabulous.  Probably the best Cesar salad I've ever had, definitely the best croutons.  Butternut squash gnocchi with brown butter sage and toasted pecans - OMG my stomach was hurting, but I savored every bite.  (This is the second time in a month weve had a pasta type dish with a brown butter and sage sauce - must learn to do that at home!).  The rosemary lemon chicken was the best roasted-type chicken I've ever had - and not overly lemony at all like you might fear.  Shrimp Saltimboca was absolutely delicious, really absolutely perfect.They even roasted zucchini with one of the courses, for pete's sake, I can't remember where, that was accented with tarragon.  Yes, tarragon on zucchini squash... and OMG, it was delicious.What I especially loved, though, isn't even the food (although I did), but the energy of the servers and the kitchen staff, and how it was apparent at every moment that they ALL loved their jobs, and Mangia is truly a celebration, complete with singing, dancing, clapping, and all other sorts of audience participation.  The servers will give you helpful tips like go light on the bread and pace yourself - you'll do well to listen.  It is LOUD, so if you are planning a get together with friends you haven't seen in a while and you want to catch up, this isn't it.  But if you are planning a get together with friends and you can catch up before or after, then this is \"the adult Chuck E. Cheese\" as Chef Nick said during his \"family celebration\" time.If you have told me earlier that I would mambo around Cool Cafe with strangers, I would've said you don't know me very well.  But mambo I did, along with most every other woman in the approximately 90 in attendance (the men were conspiculously observing... hmmm) - but I'm sorry, when a mirror ball starts spinning and ligts going and the Chef is on percussion in the kitchen with spoons... come on, you've just got to join in.  (Our server called it the \"digestion dance,\" and so appropriate!)Canolis for dessert were the perfect size, and they even send you home with a bag of doughnuts (a la beignet style) that our server are even more delicious the next morning with your coffee.  She was right about that, too.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

I got out of there for around $70 for just me including cocktails - a splurge on my budget for sure, but I'm glad I did it.  Even though the menu is set, you can look it up a head of time and there is a wide enough range of dishes that there's something for everyone.  I'm sure the menu changes, but at least that was the case when I went.I was honestly a little underwhelmed at some of the dishes, but most of them were amazing.  I guess from everything I'd heard I expected to be consistently wow'ed with every course, but how realistic is that, really?It's community seating and family-style serving, so go prepared to make friends!Also, there is a mid-meal dance break.

By day, it's a southern meat + 3, but on Friday and Saturday evenings it turns into a 13-course fine dining Italian marathon. And from what I understand, under completely different staff and ownership.  My friend Cat had read about this place in the Nashville Scene. She referred to it as \"gorilla style.\"  It took her MONTHS to get a reservations for our party of 8. Walk-ins are not welcome. All the parties in the restaurant had at least 6 in their group. Because everything is served family-style, I suspect a group is required, but I'm not positive about that. I completely devoured every single one of my THIRTEEN courses. Highlights included: fried stuffed olives, cipollini reduced onions, lemon risotto cakes, mozzarella carrozza, two salads, two pastas, veal osso buco, rosemary chicken, mussels, and two dessert courses. It  took us over THREE HOURS to complete the courses. Each one was better than the prior! Amazing really. The cost is $45 per and there is a $5 corkage fee for BYOB. The atmosphere is casual. The staff sings, dances, and encourages the diners to do the same. You really do have to stand up every now and then, else you'd pop! They are even running The Godfather on the tele! The only thing missing was good coffee to accompany desert. But they aren't losing a star for it. Just a suggestion. I can't recommend this place highly enough. I understand that an expansion is in the works and I can't wait to go back!!!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

If you're a person who loves to eat, drink, sing, eat, meet people and have fun, dance, eat, drink and do it all over again this is your heavenly place. During the week this strip mall location is a meat and three, two nights a week in turns into a family style home cooked italian event. Reservations are required and usually booked up months in advance so call them today! You are seated in groups of 4-6-8 or 10. Your server is outgoing and shakes your hand and you really feel like she's your cousin and you've know her for years. For a flat $40, and $5 corking fee (bring your own wine!) you will eat more food than you've ever eaten before. Three appetizers, two salads, two pastas, three meat and two desserts. Frank Sinatra and Louis Prima music plays, and on the tv is the Godfather. In between Pasta and Meats there is some encouraged dancing and sing alongs but I don't want to give away all the fun.  This is a 2-3 hour meal. Nick is the head chef, dancer, creator, host of this dining event. His wife and son are by his side enjoying the fun. Why are there NO photos of this event? Because you're just too busy eating, mingling and dancing to stop and think of your yelp review. If you're out going and like to eat, go here.

    "comments": "Mangia is more of an experience than a restaurant.  Take some friends or make some there.  It's one of those family style restaurants where you sit w/ stranger (or new friends) if you didn't bring a group of 8 ppl. Food is definitely authentic.  Not everything is a hit, but most of it is.  And the entrees that are hit, they clearly are exceptional.Here are the highlights:- The food is overall outstanding (I can't guarantee that you'll like it all, but you will wanna come back)- The atmosphere is happy and delightful- The experience is unique to NashvilleTIP:  You can bring your own alcohol.  Bring a couple bottles of wine to share, and if you run out there's a wine store right next door to stock back up.Go on facebook and try to catch one of the drop reservations.  It's happens every weekend, so you'll eventually get your shot.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Delicious food, fun environment, as well as entertaining. The quantity and quality of food was fabulous. Most important to us, is I have a large number of unusual allergies, which frequently make dining a bad experience ... and so I was concerned about this family style event. It couldn't have been better ... Nick personally communicated with me ahead of time, providing detailed information, options and an overall mastery of the menu. That night both he and the staff insured I did not eat problematic foods, provided extra quantities of those I could and make a special pasta and chicken to order (while not making me feel uncomfortable about these changes to the overall fixed menu). WONDERFUL! Multiple appetizers, bread, salad, pastas (plural), entree and several desserts ... an amazing dinner. One cannot ask for more ...custom food choices for those in need (like me), great service, fun and a sense of community. We will definitely be back!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "What a neat experience. My husband and I, celebrating our 11th anniversary, decided to venture out to Mangia. It was a lot of fun and all the food was fantastic. I am vegetarian and found them to be extremely accommodating. A good portion of their menu was already vegetarian friendly. I think it is difficult to make Italian food taste original/special but I did feel like the food was good. Moreover, the service was outstanding. Our server paid attention to every detail. The atmosphere is very lively and loud. Even so, we were nestled in a corner and found it to be romantic. There is a interlude/dance time between the anti-pasta and main dish. I will admit, I found this to be a bit forced/contrived. even so, once I got past my own inhibition I found that I was having a really good time. There is a very personable feel in the restaurant. In some ways, it feels like you're at a celebration event/wedding. I suppose that could feel good or bad depending on your preference, LOL! Overall, good experience. I would absolutely come back. If you come here for dinner, just be aware it is loud, it is boisterous, and it is more like an experience rather than a simple \"sit-down dinner.\"\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I will try to give a synopsis of an amazingly over-the-top Italian Dining Event that I recently \"experienced\" at Mangia (Mohn'-zjuh). Chef, owner - Nick Pellegrino.Wow, first, go hungry, but not so much so that you will faint; hint, if you hit the movies the afternoon of the same evening you'll hit Mangia, eating popcorn or other movie snacks is not a good plan.... Second, drink lots of water all thru the day of your evening date at Mangia, you'll be so glad you did, more on that later!) Third, definitely review the menu before you go (\"like\" them on fb), yes, you'll begin to salivate in anticipation - AND... it will help you know what kinds of wines to bring as it is BYOB (if you are stumped here, then take a copy of the menu to your local wine geek). Fourth, once you are there, seated and getting excited about this evening of homemade Italian dining, don't fill up on the bread. (They'll tell you that, and do listen to your server!) Fifth, prepare yourself for a long, loud, fun, food-fest filled with music, singing, dancing, and an intermission! You'll need it, we all did, at almost 75 people,  the place was almost entirely filled to their seating max. Further, if you go on a Friday evening (seating doesn't happen until 8:00), tell your sitter you'll be home late, as in 'close to midnight late', this is a full-tilt, multi-course event. And everyone gets to eat a little or a lot of everything on the menu. So, you do get serious bang for your $45 bucks/person (plus tax & tip, plus $5/bottle of wine as their corkerage fee, very reasonable - do be sure your server knows how to open the wines, tho, not kidding; ours struggled, for various reasons, but at least we did get bottle opened, finally).  When you arrive, you're welcomed by Nick, Chef & Owner, then directed to your table. You'll notice that the table is fully set w/all dishes, glasses, etc. (a tip to Mangia, please use black napkins, the white is all over the black slacks! -eek!), for the wine, smart choice - small glasses juice glasses! nice touch! The servers bring and explain every dish, one was even brought to our table by Chef Nick! Here's the thing, this food service doesn't happen fast but gradually throughout the evening. The food unfolds, you eat, drink, talk, over & over, course after course. Word to the wise: take your time, don't over stuff, it isn't worth it. If you taste something and it's just \"okay\" take a few more bites then stop..something else will wow you even more!At one point, about mid-event & before the main courses were served, Chef Nick took to the microphone to welcome all & explain we would take a short break, right then. This was a smart move, we were all getting kinda full by then - so more dancing and singing ensued (to the Italian and oldies selection, a great mix, many sung by Italian artists, of course, from Dean Martin to Frank Valli) playing thru the sound system. At this point in the evening, Mangia officially becomes a very loud place...imagine we could be heard all the way to Hillsboro Road!Pointers to Mangia - please get some whole pepper grinders to have at the ready when requested, 'twould be so the nice touch. I was rather surprised when I asked for one to find that none were present. Also, no salt & shakers on any table, at all, learned later that typical Italian meals do not require such ergo they're not on table & it could be an insult to ask for same (oops!!)...not needed by & large, using some of the freshly grated Pecorino helped...but....read on - to Mangia:, please salt the pasta water for the shells (used with the short rib bolognese), it really needs it, also shells were watery and had not even a hint of EVOO...(the meat sauce wasn't flavorful, which was sad...I kept trying to find it, the flavor that is. Possibly the beef had not been salted prior to cooking?) The pasta with the citrus cream sauce was amazing, divine, I could eat that again right now. The orange zest (right?) was a fabulous touch! The other best dish was the rosemary lemon chicken, very tasty! The freshly made-that-morning-sausage with fennel was rich and moist, if a bit too fennel-y.Oh yeah, why drink a lot of water all that day? Because you will likely be sipping a lot of wine that evening...even if sipping water, too, that eve, you will be glad to be so well  hydrated in advance of your Italian dining, sipping & singing event!All in all, the crowning touch was the wee brown bag given to us as we departed, holding xxx sugar and two, fresh, hot Italian \"dough-nuts\", or Zeppole. The plan: shake 'em in the sugar and enjoy, which I did, both of them..oh my so very good...as in melt-in-your-mouth (the watermelon granita served prior to these sweet goodies was refreshing, but too sweet!)Yes, go to Mangia, IF you can get in! I was really fortunate to get a place for myself and my pal...we both agreed we would enjoy going again (when they change their menu) with a small group of friends and fellow foodies!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Mangia is a great little \"foodie\" secret in Franklin, TN. The brainchild of chef Nick Pellegrino, Mangia is fairly secretive. Why? Because by day it's a great little meat and three called The Cool Cafe run by owner/chef Tim Ness. Great guy. Nick and Tim are friends, and Nick presented Tim with the idea of offering a classic Italian feast experience on Saturday nights (when The Cool Cafe is closed). The idea took off and now they offer single seatings on both Friday and Saturday nights. The Mangia experience is only available by reservation, and they are booked months in advance. To transform The Cool Cafe into Mangia, they black out the windows, dim the lights, cover the tables with white tablecloths and break out the real plates and forks. Mangia is fixed price ($40 per person) and that includes everything on the menu served family style. The menu changes monthly. The night we went: Sesame bread (served with garlic and rosemary olive oil) was great. Three appetizers, two salads and two pastas, then we took a 30 minute break. The whole place sang and danced. Nick came out and offered a toast. The Godfather was silently playing on the television in the background while Sinatra played over the house speakers. Then for the main courses. There were three of them as well, plus a vegetable. Then two desserts finish things off nicely. Fresh canolis and zeppole the night we went. The food was fantastic, and you can bring your own wine ($5 corkage fee) or the wine shop next door offers Mangia patrons a 10% discount. The servers were great, and Nick personally came over to the table several times to make sure we were having a good time. Amazing experience. We went with another couple on a Friday night and had so much fun that we've decided to make it a monthly tradition.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

No.  When I can have the same experience in a 2 1/2 or so hour window I would definitely go back.  Otherwise no way.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "This place is right off the main tourist drag in Nashville. You know that whole area no one who lives in or near Nashville actually goes to unless there's an event? Yep. Swarms of people, overpriced food and drinks, loud music from wannabe country stars doing 90s cover songs. We were going to a concert at Bridgestone and wanted grub first but not bar food when we found this place which serves breakfast and sandwiches all day.I'm a sucker for good chicken and waffles so I ordered that. Sun's version is unique in that they cover it all in sausage gravy which I've never seen done. The chicken was good, the waffle was delicious, and the gravy was pretty good. However I think the chicken and waffles would've been better with the gravy separate, maybe with a biscuit. It wasn't bad by any means, just that it kind of takes away from the chicken -waffle combo to overpower it with sausage gravy. My wife had chicken and fries and the fries were great- almost unsalted but very crisp and I'd much rather have to add salt then have something served too salty.Other menu items like the patty melt and some of the desserts looks good but it is a relatively small menu. A few beers in bottles if you need a drink and off the main drag where bars litter the landscape it's a pretty safe bet that all day breakfast is a good racket to be in.'50s music and a plethora of Sun record memorabilia are in abundance. Kind of a surprising theme for a place with prime Nashville real estate since sun records is a Memphis rather than a Nashville thing.All in all great service, pretty good food, and a bit pricey for what it is but not devastatingly so.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

This diner is conveniently located right off of Broadway and its 24 hours!! When we arrived, there was open seating so we got a spot at one of the horseshoe tables at the bar (there are two booths at the end of the restaurant and the majority of seating is bar seating shaped as horseshoes - there are 3 of them). I love breakfast wraps so that is what I went with. The wrap was really good, i would not say it was small. The hash browns at Sun Diner are so good - they aren't what I typically put in the category of \"hash browns\" though. The side dish involves cubed potatoes and include a variety of potato types, a great twist.If you're looking for some food late at night/during odd hours - this is the place!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I was staying downtown for work, and I needed to grab lunch before a meeting.  I walked into Sun Diner, a pretty new spot at the time, because there aren't a ton of restaurants downtown with awesome reviews.  This one looked intriguing, and I love breakfast food any time of day.  I loved the decor and layout!  Really fitting for Music City, delightfully retro.  Most of the seating is at the counter, which is casual and laid back.  The food was pretty good.  I had a breakfast burrito.  The potatoes surprised me because there were sweet ones in the mix, not bad.  I got the wrong tea from my server at first, but it was corrected pretty easily.  Prices are on par for downtown, touristy Nashville.  Steep but expected.My one complaint is that I had to pay at the register, which is located by the door, and there just isn't much space there if there's a line.  I kept bumping into people entering the restaurant while I waited.Overall, I'd say this is a safe bet when you're downtown, and I think it would taste even better at 3am.  After all, it's a 24-hour diner!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "Sun Diner is a relatively new addition to the Downtown Nashville eateries. So new, that our hotel shuttle driver didn't even know about the place. We visited on a Monday afternoon and there were just about two other couples dining. We received a hearty welcome from at least 3 members of staff and made our way to a booth at the back of diner. The layout of the diner is unique with 3 large rectangular slab counters surrounded by stools and 2 booths at the far back. In keeping with the Music City theme, the walls are covered with are pictures and art work depicting a rich musical history. Our waiter had me on the fence, carefree but a cool dude. Rather than resting items on the table he tossed them at us. His actions reminded me of those servers at Dick's Last Resort but without the verbal slurs. The chef was quite friendly though.We tried:- Donut breakfast sandwich: Donuts are on my list of 'Retired foods' since I ate too much as a child but somehow I could not resist the idea of a glazed donut with eggs. Yes, it's was as yummy as it sounds!- Feeling Good Breakfast Burger: Oh my goodness, the bread! Really, who raves about bread? It was that good! Juicy patty crowned with and a glorious sunny side up egg.- Strawberry banana milkshake: Meh, not as rich and creamy as I like my milkshakes to be but it was okay.This place is worth a try!  Menu 4/5Service 2/5Taste 3/5Location 5/5\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I dine in or place a to-go order weekly at the Sun Diner, and am consistently impressed. The food comes out quickly, always tastes great, and the staff is friendly. If you're looking for a filling meal, order the Breakfast wrap with hash browns, and a cinnamon roll for dessert. The wrap is a huge portion you could easily split, the hash browns are unique and delicious (think diced, seasoned, and skillet-fried regular, purple, and sweet potatoes), and the cinnamon rolls are soft and delicious. It's a 24/7 restaurant with all-day breakfast, so that's a definite plus when you've been working late downtown and need a bite to eat past typical dinner hours. Keep in mind their busiest times are breakfast and late night, so wait times will be higher. Stay patient- it's worth the wait. My main reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the inconvenience with ordering a to-go order over the phone, since the Diner shares a phone with Luigi's Pizza next door (same owners, connected buildings). It would be much easier if management had separate phone lines, since it takes a while for Luigi's to physically walk the phone over to Sun Diner.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

It was opened 4 months ago, according to our waitress. We had breakfast at this 24/7 diner. My husband had a quad combo of a huge moist pancake, perfectly done 4 strips of bacon, cook to order eggs (he chose egg white) and scrumptious potato fries. Loved it, and the portion was generous. I ordered the lox and bagel. This was just OK. It did not come with eggs or onion as expected. The smoked salmon was on the skimpy side for this order.

Our friendly waitress greeted us immediately. After seeing the glazed donut breakfast sandwich on the menu I knew I couldn't get anything else. I ordered it and the breakfast potatoes. The sandwich is a sausage egg and cheese sandwich, between 2 hot glazed donuts. Oh Boy was it rich, but I powered through. Not sure I would get it again, I usually eat very healthily but it was definitely worth the calories. I would definitely go back to the diner as often as possible, it's great.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

We didn't wait but 30 mins for a seat together but the group of 6 that was there before us was still waiting to be seated together by the time we had ordered. That being said, that was the only fault I could find with this place.  The food was phenomenal. I am not a waffle eater but I could have eaten a dozen of theirs. I had the quartet breakfast with eggs, hash browns, sausage, and crispy bacon and then I added a waffle. It was all so good I wish I could have stayed and ate more. Our service was good in that the guy kept our drinks fill and even offered a to go one when we were leaving. Even with the seating arrangement we never felt rushed to get up and leave. I will go back but I wouldn't suggest this place with a large group unless you are willing to split up into smaller groups.

They are made fresh with the perfect ratio of chicken to batter. The French Toast was phenomenal and the Short Rib Hash was also top notch. My girlfriend and I also decided to try one of their cinnamon rolls and that was crazy good as well. Stayed in Nashville for 4 days and this is the only place I revisited more than once (stopped by 3 times!). In short, this is a must try place while on broadway in Nashville.

It's mostly counter seating and the interior is fun, very well to the theme if I ignore the city it's located it. Service was really friendly and prompt, always a good sign. My husband had the short rib hash and I had the grilled cheese burger - we both liked each others better but soon neither one of us felt very good because the dishes are ridiculously greasy. Although the taste was good I won't be back because the price point was steep - $16 for a burger with essentially extra cheese on toast , nope. Plus seriously, I cannot state enough how greasy it was and I'm no stranger to fried foods and grease.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "I went to the Sun Diner last night, I really enjoyed the lay out and the food. I had the chicken and waffles. While my food was good, the manager ruined the experience for me. He was yelling and talking down to all of his employees like they were worthless. I could see that it was having a negative effect on the workers and that directly effects the atmosphere of the restaurant. I think the way he speaks to the workers needs to be addressed.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "So we got a first class escort through Tequila Cowboy by the man promoting on the street. We happened upon the diner through a random back door and we're greeted by our first class server Tee Tee. She explained the diner was new and did an amazing job at making sure no matter what we wanted was taken care of. The food was great, we had the chicken and waffles as well as the American patty melt. All the food was prepared well and brought out to us by the great team of cooks and servers. If you're in the area I would highly recommend stopping in. We had this place late night but don't be afraid to come during the day and normal people hours. Enjoy!\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

Best service and best food by far during our visit to Nashville. Huge portions. Well worth the price. Everything subtlety seasoned expertly. My only complaint is I wish we had this place where we live near Philly.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

    "comments": "The Breakfast Taco was good enough to eat although nothing special about it. Service was poor and very slow. Two servers taking care of breakfast guests with no support from management. The servers are inexperienced and overwhelmed. It took 10 minutes before my order was taken, and it took 25 minutes for my food to come out. There is no teamwork at all inside this restaurant.One last thing, the place is overpriced and overrated. The menu was small but the prices are outrageous. You are definitely paying for the location and not the quality of food. The ingredients are low quality and store bought, and then they tack on their Downtown Nashville mark up. A guest would be better off going to an I-Hop or Waffle House for the same quality and at a price that will not leave you broke.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",
